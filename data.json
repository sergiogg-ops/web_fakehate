Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.\n\nIt is wonderful to be here with all of you.\n\nTo be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.\n\nTo be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.\n\nTo be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.\n\nAnd in a place\u2026 with absolutely no ceilings.\n\nYou know, President Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation\u2019s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nTwo Democrats guided by the \u2014 Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\n\nPresident Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there\u2019s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: \u201cEquality of opportunity\u2026 Jobs for those who can work\u2026 Security for those who need it\u2026 The ending of special privilege for the few\u2026 The preservation of civil liberties for all\u2026 a wider and constantly rising standard of living.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds good to me.\n\nIt\u2019s America\u2019s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.\n\nThat bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.\n\nIt\u2019s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.\n\nIt\u2019s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.\n\nWhen President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.\n\nWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.\n\nWe\u2019re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.\n\nInstead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the end.\n\nAs we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.\n\nYou worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs\u2026 you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again \u2013 going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.\n\nSo we\u2019re standing again. But, we all know we\u2019re not yet running the way America should.\n\nYou see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.\n\nWhile many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\u2019s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.\n\nSo, you have to wonder: \u201cWhen does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\nI say now.\n\nProsperity can\u2019t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.\n\nDemocracy can\u2019t be just for billionaires and corporations.\n\nProsperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.\n\nYou brought our country back.\n\nNow it\u2019s time \u2014 your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\n\nAnd, you know what?\n\nAmerica can\u2019t succeed unless you succeed.\n\nThat is why I am running for President of the United States.\n\nHere, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.\n\nI\u2019m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.\n\nFor the successful and the struggling.\n\nFor the innovators and inventors.\n\nFor those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.\n\nFor the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.\n\nFor the nurses who work the night shift.\n\nFor the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.\n\nFor the veterans who served our country.\n\nFor the small business owners who took a risk.\n\nFor everyone who\u2019s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\n\nI\u2019m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.\n\nOur country\u2019s challenges didn\u2019t begin with the Great Recession and they won\u2019t end with the recovery.\n\nFor decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.\n\nAdvances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.\n\nThe financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value\u2026 too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.\n\nOur political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they\u2019ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.\n\nNow, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we\u2019ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.\n\nOur next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that \u2014 to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.\n\nAt our best, that\u2019s what Americans do. We\u2019re problem solvers, not deniers. We don\u2019t hide from change, we harness it.\n\nBut we can\u2019t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.\n\nAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.\n\nNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\u2019re all singing the same old song\u2026\n\nA song called \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nYou know the one \u2014 all our troubles look as though they\u2019re here to stay\u2026 and we need a place to hide away\u2026 They believe in yesterday.\n\nAnd you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try singing that, too, I\u2019ll tell you!\n\nThese Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.\n\nAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\u2019ll say: \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d Well, then, why don\u2019t they start listening to those who are?\n\nThey pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.\n\nThey want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.\n\nThey shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.\n\nThey want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.\n\nAnd they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.\n\nFundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called \u201ca village\u201d that has a place for everyone.\n\nNow, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.\n\nI believe that success isn\u2019t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty\u2026\n\nHow many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive\u2026\n\nHow many young people go to college without drowning in debt\u2026\n\nHow many people find a good job\u2026\n\nHow many families get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nI didn\u2019t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.\n\nMy mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.\n\nHer own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.\n\nYou know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.\n\nThe 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.\n\nThe woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.\n\nAnd, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.\n\nTo meet every challenge.\n\nTo be resilient\u2026 no matter what the world throws at you.\n\nTo solve the toughest problems.\n\nI believe we can do all these things because I\u2019ve seen it happen.\n\nAs a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.\n\nMy first job out of law school was for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn\u2019t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.\n\nAs a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.\n\nIn Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.\n\nAs Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9\/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.\n\nIt took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.\n\nThere are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.\n\nJust weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn\u2019t quite so hard for families like hers?\n\nI want to be her champion and your champion.\n\nIf you\u2019ll give me the chance, I\u2019ll wage and win Four Fights for you.\n\nThe first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\n\nTo make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.\n\nThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nIs this possible in today\u2019s world?\n\nI believe it is or I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\n\nDo I think it will be easy? Of course not.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can\u2019t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.\n\nThere are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.\n\nBusiness leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.\n\nThere are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.\n\nThere are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow\u2019s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\u2019ll propose specific policies to:\n\nReward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck \u2013 because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.\n\nI will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.\n\nI will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.\n\nWe will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.\n\nWe will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.\n\nAnd we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\n\nDeveloping renewable power \u2013 wind, solar, advanced biofuels\u2026\n\nBuilding cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings\u2026\n\nUsing additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment\u2026\n\nAnd ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.\n\nNow, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.\n\nWe will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.\n\nWe will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.\n\nNow, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.\n\nThat\u2019s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.\n\nAnd I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that talent is universal \u2013 you can find it anywhere \u2013 but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.\n\nOur country won\u2019t be competitive or fair if we don\u2019t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.\n\nSo let\u2019s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.\n\nLet\u2019s make college affordable and available to all \u2026and lift the crushing burden of student debt.\n\nLet\u2019s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.\n\nNow, the second fight is to strengthen America\u2019s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.\n\nAnd today\u2019s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.\n\nI believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.\n\nI believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.\n\nI believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.\n\nThat you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.\n\nI believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.\n\nAnd it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job \u2014 and women of color often making even less.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.\n\nIn America, every family should feel like they belong.\n\nSo we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.\n\nAnd, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.\n\nYou know, America\u2019s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what\u2019s drawn so many to our shores. What\u2019s inspired people all over the world. I know. I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\n\nAnd these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.\n\nSo we have a third fight: to harness all of America\u2019s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.\n\nNo other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran \u2013 and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.\n\nNo other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.\n\nAs your President, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.\n\nAnd if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.\n\nAs a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today\u2019s threats and tomorrow\u2019s.\n\nAnd when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I\u2019ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they\u2019ve earned.\n\nI\u2019ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.\n\nBut, I know \u2014 I know we have to be smart as well as strong.\n\nMeeting today\u2019s global challenges requires every element of America\u2019s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.\n\nThere are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there\u2019s a lot of good news out there too.\n\nI believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.\n\nAnd we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That\u2019s why we have to win the fourth fight \u2013 reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.\n\nWe have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.\n\nWe need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\u2019s right to vote, rather than every corporation\u2019s right to buy elections.\n\nIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nI want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.\n\nI\u2019ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.\n\nWhat part of democracy are they afraid of?\n\nNo matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.\n\nGovernment is never going to have all the answers \u2013 but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.\n\nThat means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.\n\nWe need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.\n\nTo do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I\u2019ll also stand my ground when I must.\n\nThat\u2019s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State \u2014 whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities \u2014 and it\u2019s something I will always do as your President.\n\nWe Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other\u2019s back.\n\nLike any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.\n\nPeople all over the world have asked me: \u201cHow could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?\u201d\n\nNow, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled \u2013 even killed \u2013 not hired as Secretary of State.\n\nBut President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That\u2019s how we do it in America.\n\nWith that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.\n\nWe can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.\n\nWe can strengthen our families.\n\nWe can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.\n\nAnd we can renew the promise of our democracy.\n\nIf we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.\n\nI want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.\n\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.\n\nText \u201cJOIN\u201d J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6.\n\nGo to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I\u2019m not stopping now.\n\nYou know, I know how hard this job is. I\u2019ve seen it up close and personal.\n\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.\n\nWell, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!\n\nAnd the first grandmother as well.\n\nAnd one additional advantage: You\u2019re won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\u2019ve been coloring it for years!\n\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I\u2019m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.\n\nAnd along the way, I\u2019ll just let you in on this little secret. I won\u2019t get everything right. Lord knows I\u2019ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there\u2019s no shortage of people pointing them out!\n\nAnd I certainly haven\u2019t won every battle I\u2019ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.\n\nI think you know by now that I\u2019ve been called many things by many people \u2014 \u201cquitter\u201d is not one of them.\n\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.\n\nWhen I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I\u2019d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\n\nI can still hear her saying: \u201cLife\u2019s not about what happens to you, it\u2019s about what you do with what happens to you \u2013 so get back out there.\u201d\n\nShe lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century \u2014 all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.\n\nShe was born on June 4, 1919 \u2014 before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.\n\nThe story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us \u2013 not just some, but all \u2013 should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.\n\nNot only because we\u2019re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we\u2019re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.\n\nI wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.\n\nI wish she could have seen the America we\u2019re going to build together.\n\nAn America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.\n\nWhere we don\u2019t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.\n\nAn America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.\n\nThank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","images":["https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"],"top_img":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1","keywords":[],"authors":["Sam Frizell"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","title":"Hillary Clinton Transcript: Read Full Text of Clinton Campaign Launch","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","theme-color":"#e90606","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","application-name":"nextgen","author":"Sam Frizell","creator":"Sam Frizell","category":"Politics","fb":{"app_id":991230477954201,"pages":10606591490},"article":{"opinion":"false","content_tier":"free","published_time":"2015-06-13T18:32:48"},"pinterest":{"url":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","media":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"},"amphtml":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/?amp=true","format-detection":"telephone=no","og":{"title":"Read the full text of Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","site_name":"TIME","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1","width":1200,"height":628},"type":"article"},"twitter":{"card":"summary_large_image","site":"@TIME","title":"Read the full text of Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","image":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"http:\/\/time.com","summary":"","label":"Real"},{"id":null,"text":"Alaska Statewide 'Opinion Counts' Survey Results Survey conducted 7\/24\/08 - 7\/25\/08 Remember to click here and add your email address to our new mailing list and receive survey results in your mailbox every month.

Survey Methodology This survey was fielded July 24 -25, 2008 as part of the Hays Research Group Statewide Opinion Counts Survey. 404 completed respondents were interviewed The margin of error for the data collected is +\/- 4.86 % for a 404 response survey for the data analyzed in its entirety with a 95% confidence level; meaning that we can be 95% sure that if every resident of the State with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections was actually surveyed, the results would vary by no more than 4.86% in either direction. The survey sample used was a computer generated random list derived from a database of all households within the State of Alaska with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections. The sample frame was designed to accurately reflect the actual population percentages. Respondents were screened to confirm they were over 18 and each household was attempted at least four times over a period of several days to account for non-response bias. Data was analyzed utilizing SPSS Quancept Software. Interviews were conducted by trained staff with on-site supervision utilizing state of the art computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Random interviews were monitored to assure quality control measures were followed. Dialing results were analyzed daily to assure statistically accurate distribution of call disposition in order to account for \u201cnon-response\u201d variables.

Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.\n\nRank\tCause of death\tNumber of deaths\tNumber gun-related\n1st\tHomicide\t2,416\t2,256\n2nd\tUnintentional injuries\t1,135\t47\n3rd\tSuicide\t448\t230\n4th\tHeart disease\t172\t--\n5th\tCancer\t161\t--\n6th\tHIV\t52\t--\n7th\tChronic lower respiratory diseases\t47\t--\n8th\tCongenital anomalies\t38\t--\n9th\tAnemia\t33\t--\n10th\tDiabetes\t33\t--\n\nTotal, 2nd through 9th place\n\n--\n\n2,119\n\n--\n\nSo even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton\u2019s statement correct.\n\nIf you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.\n\nThere were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.\n\nWe should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.\n\nThat said, we think Clinton\u2019s definition of \"young\" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.\n\nOur ruling\n\nClinton said, \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\"\n\nAs long as you define \"young\" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton\u2019s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

Task Force, Lone Democrat Eye Trafficking Law\n\nBy Emma Dumain\n\nThe House GOP task force charged with making recommendations to colleagues on the influx of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border might suggest controversial changes to a 2008 trafficking law \u2014 and at least one Democrat wants to go that route as well.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who made headlines on Wednesday for blasting President Barack Obama\u2019s failure to visit the border during a fundraising trip to the area, said he would soon introduce legislation to allow all children apprehended at the southwest border to qualify for \u201cvoluntary return\u201d to their home countries.\n\nA law known as the \u201cWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\u201d gave that right only to children from counties \u201ccontiguous\u201d to the United States, namely Mexico and Canada. Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2014 among other parts of Central America \u2014 Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms.\n\n\u201cAll the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime,\u201d Cuellar told a group of reporters. \u201dThe only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\u201d\n\nCuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with \u201ca little bit of experience\u201d \u2014 a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican \u2014 would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol.\n\nObama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking.\n\nBut most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. \u201cI think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him.\u201d\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday \u2014 and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law.\n\nHe said he had \u201csuspected all along\u201d that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obama\u2019s pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a position that protects children,\u201d Grijalva said, \u201cand a Republican effort \u2026 to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com:80\/218\/immigration-news-congress-changes-to-trafficking-law\/?dcz=","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/02\/218_FinalThreeBloggers.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714-445x304.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6036424&cv=2.0&cj=1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/cdn.rollcall.com\/media\/ui\/pwLogoOverlay.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/themes\/rollcall-blog-regular\/images\/comments-balloon-icon-mini.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/themes\/rollcall-blog-regular\/images\/RC_logo-200px_horz.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/wp-content\/themes\/rollcall-blog-regular\/images\/comments-balloon-icon-mini.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714.jpg?resize=445%2C304"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714-445x304.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":["Brenda Huddleston","Charlene Weshley"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/immigration-news-congress-changes-to-trafficking-law\/","title":"Immigration News: Congress Eyes Changes to Trafficking Law","meta_data":{"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=433753469","description":"A Republican task force responding to immigration news amid the child migrant crisis is recommending Congress revisit a 2008 trafficking law.","twitter":{"card":"summary","site":"@","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/goppers\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/05\/goppers-header-logo-faceless.png","description":"A Republican task force responding to immigration news amid the child migrant crisis is recommending Congress revisit a 2008 trafficking law."},"og":{"locale":"en_US","title":"Immigration News: Congress Eyes Changes to Trafficking Law","description":"A Republican task force responding to immigration news amid the child migrant crisis is recommending Congress revisit a 2008 trafficking law.","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/immigration-news-congress-changes-to-trafficking-law\/","site_name":218,"type":"article","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714-445x304.jpg"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":"Real"},{"id":null,"text":"A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.\n\nThe ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.\n\n\"John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,\" the narrator says.\n\nThe stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.\n\n\"Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.\"\n\nWith images such as a newspaper headline that says \"McCain climate views clash with GOP,\" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.\n\nIndeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.\n\nWhen he introduced the bill, McCain called it \"the first comprehensive piece of legislation\" in capping emissions.\n\n\"The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \"It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.\"\n\nBy contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.\n\nManik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9\/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in \"educating the Senate\" about how government could respond to global warming.\n\n\"It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,\" Roy said.\n\nHe called McCain \"a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.\"\n\nAnd so we find McCain's statement to be True.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake

As the \"greatest generation\" did before us, we must move beyond political camps to unite around bold actions in order to build a strong America and a safer world. We must strengthen our military and economy, achieve energy independence, reenergize civilian and interagency capabilities, and revitalize our alliances. Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTopics:\n\nU.S. policy and politics\n\nNational security and defense\n\nWASHINGTON DIVIDED Less than six years after 9\/11, Washington is as divided and conflicted over foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously declared that \"politics stops at the water's edge\"; today, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declares that our major political parties should carry out two separate foreign policies. The Senate unanimously confirmed General David Petraeus, who pledged to implement a new strategy, as the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Yet just weeks later, the Senate began crafting legislation specifically designed to stop that new strategy. More broadly, lines have been drawn between those labeled \"realists\" and those labeled \"neoconservatives.\" Yet these terms mean little when even the most committed neoconservative recognizes that any successful policy must be grounded in reality and even the most hardened realist admits that much of the United States' power and influence stems from its values and ideals. In the midst of these divisions, the American people -- and many others around the world -- have increasing doubts about the United States' direction and role in the world. Indeed, it seems that concern about Washington's divisiveness and capability to meet today's challenges is the one thing that unites us all. We need new thinking on foreign policy and an overarching strategy that can unite the United States and its allies -- not around a particular political camp or foreign policy school but around a shared understanding of how to meet a new generation of challenges. A GENERATION'S LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP Today's challenges are daunting. They include the conflict in Iraq, the resurgence of the Taliban, and global terrorist networks made even more menacing by the threat of nuclear proliferation. While Iran's leaders relentlessly pursue nuclear weapons capabilities and spout genocidal threats against Israel, the world largely stands silent, unable to agree on effective sanctions even as each day the danger grows. Genocide ravages Darfur even as the world stands frozen. In Latin America, leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez seek to reverse the spread of freedom and return to failed authoritarian policies. AIDS and potential new pandemics threaten us in an interconnected world. The economic rise of China and other countries across Asia poses a different type of challenge. It is easy to understand why Americans -- and many others around the world -- feel so much unease and uncertainty. Yet although we face fundamentally different issues today, the United States has a history of rising to meet even greater challenges. Indeed, we need not look to ancient history, but only to the courage and determination of our parents and grandparents to see a stark contrast with the confusion and infighting of Washington today. Just over 60 years ago, we were in the midst of a global war that would take the lives of tens of millions. The outcome was far from certain. General Dwight Eisenhower drafted a short note before the D-day landings at Normandy accepting full responsibility \"in case of failure.\" The invasion did not fail. Yet no sooner had we defeated fascism than we were engaged in a 50-year struggle with communism. Those whom the journalist Tom Brokaw memorialized as \"the greatest generation\" made the tough choices that allowed us to prevail in these struggles. And it was not just our Washington leaders who were decisive. In the 1940s, Americans rationed and saved, and mothers and daughters enlisted to work in factories. Together with the GIs who returned home, they built this country's prosperity and fueled a sense of optimism. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, America pursued learning and innovation to lead the world in space, technology, and productivity -- outcompeting the Soviets and driving them to an economic bankruptcy that matched their moral bankruptcy. In the aftermath of World War II and with the coming of the Cold War, members of \"the greatest generation\" united America and the free world around shared values and actions that changed history. They unified U.S. military and security efforts, creating the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. They rethought U.S. approaches to the world, building the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Peace Corps. They forged alliances, such as NATO, that magnified the power of freedom and created a world trading system that helped launch the greatest expansion of economic and political freedom and development in history. Our times call for equally bold leadership and for a renewed sense of service and shared sacrifice among Americans and our allies around the world","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake

\u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live\u201d carried NBC to a win in the Nielsen overnight ratings on Easter Sunday.\n\nAiring from 8-10:23 p.m., \u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live\u201d drew a 1.7 rating in adults 18-49 and 9.4 million viewers. NBC\u2019s last live musical, \u201cHairspray Live,\u201d drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 9 million viewers back in December 2016. It is also up slightly over Fox\u2019s live version of the religious-themed \u201cThe Passion\u201d musical from March 2016, which drew a 1.6 and 6.6 million viewers. However, as \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d ended at 10:23 p.m., its initial numbers will be subject to adjustment later today.\n\nElsewhere on broadcast, a new episode of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d (1.6, 7.4 million) held steady with last week\u2019s Sunday episode. \u201cDeception\u201d (0.8, 4.2 million) ticked up slightly in the demo.\n\nFor CBS, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d (0.7, 8.1 million) unsurprisingly fell from the massive ratings drawn by the Stormy Daniels interview the show aired last week. Freshman drama \u201cInstinct\u201d (0.6, 6.7 million) slipped over 50% in the demo in its third week. \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d (0.8, 7.1 million) and \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d (0.5, 5.7 million) were also down versus last week.\n\nOn Fox, \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d (0.6, 1.5 million) took a hit, while \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d (0.9, 2 million) was even. \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d (0.8, 1.8 million) was down slightly, while \u201cFamily Guy\u201d (0.9, 2.1 million) was even. \u201cLast Man on Earth\u201d (0.6, 1.4 million) was down.\n\nNBC topped the night with a 1.3 rating and 7.4 million viewers. ABC was second in the demo with a 1.2 and third in total viewers with 5.8 million. CBS and Fox tied for third in the demo with a 0.7. CBS was second in viewers with 6.9 million. Fox was fourth in viewers with 1.7 million.\n\nThe live musical, which starred John Legend in the title role, averaged a 6.0 rating in Nielsen\u2019s metered market households. That is good enough to tie with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS in households as well as top ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which drew a 4.5. It is also on par with the 5.9 that NBC\u2019s last live musical, \u201cHairspray Live,\u201d drew back in 2016. \u201cHairspray Live\u201d ultimately drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and just over 9 million viewers, making it one of the lower-rated live broadcast musicals to date.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake

Along with the news, FX also dropped a new website and video, featuring a group of creepy clowns revealing the title. The video is marked as \u201cWeek One,\u201d with the following seven weeks locked. You can watch the full teaser above.\n\nOnce clicking on the website, users are prompted to log in through Facebook, which it says it will use to provide exclusive \u201cAHS\u201d content ahead of the new season.\n\nThe new season also got a premiere date: Sept. 5.\n\nThe announcement was made with a special presentation in the marina behind the San Diego Convention center. A floating barge sprayed a massive wall of water into the air, with the teaser being projected onto the water. You can watch video of the presentation below.\n\nPer usual, still little is known about Season 7. What we do know, however, is that \u201cAHS\u201d veterans Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson are returning, joined by franchise newcomers Billie Lourd (who worked with Murphy on \u201cScream Queens\u201d) and \u201cBilly on the Street\u2019s\u201d Billy Eichner. Lena Dunham is also joining the new season, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the lack of information so far, \u201cAHS\u201d fans still know more about Season 7 than they did at this point ahead of the previous season, \u201cRoanoke.\u201d Murphy and FX kept that installment\u2019s theme and title under wraps all the way up until its season premiere, whetting appetites with a series of mysterious teasers.\n\nFX previously renewed \u201cAHS\u201d through Season 9. Its previous seasons have tackled different narratives, but have kept certain cast members like Peters and Paulson, and intertwined some plot points through the series.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake

to her Southern roots.\n\nBischoff wore a satin column gown that she designed with Audrey Grant Bridal and carried a bouquet of blush, white and peach blooms from The Wild Dahlia, including a single Stargazer lily, her late mother Carol\u2019s favorite flower.\n\nHer beauty look was co-designed by hairstylist Jennifer Tawa and makeup artist Amanda McCarthy Beauty, from the angel wings in the

I knew that name would forever have a destructive connotation in the island and yet, I have a musical theater brain, so that\u2019s where I went in my head first and I thought, I can flip the sample,\u201d Miranda shared during an interview this morning on NBC\u2019s Today show. \u201cThe hook of almost like praying - thoughts and prayers are great; thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need supplies, we need aid, we need a government response that matches the response of our people, and that\u2019s what the song\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nMiranda says he wanted to make it a catchy tune, because \u201cit's for a good cause, but I want it to spread on its own.\" The composer last month teased on his Twitter feed that he was working on a benefit song.\n\n\u201cAlmost Like Praying,\u201d which gives a shout out to each of the island's 78 towns, was recorded in less than a week, with celebrities quick to answer his call for help. Rita Moreno, who acted in West Side Story, and whose family is also from Puerto Rico, is among the song\u2019s performers.

A Jedi craves not these things.\n\nBut a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ain't bad.\n\nMark Hamill, the legendary actor who portrayed Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars saga -- and whose incredible body of work spans movies, TV, theatre, video games, and voice-over -- received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today, which has been dubbed #JediDay. The accolade was dedicated in a ceremony at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, featuring Star Wars creator George Lucas and fellow Star Wars icon Harrison Ford, who delivered fun and touching tributes to their friend and collaborator.\n\n\"I'm very proud of Mark for getting this star,\" Lucas said. \"You've come a long way from that [Star Wars] casting session...to getting your star on Hollywood Boulevard.\"\n\nIn preparing for the event, Ford went back and watched their original screen test. \"He had just the right blend of youthfulness and enthusiasm,\" he said. Continuing, Ford expressed his joy for Hamill. \"He is, as he always was, a quiet, sincere, honest person...I'm happy for ya, pal.\"\n\nFinally, Hamill addressed the many fans in attendance. \"Words truly fail me. It's hard to convey my gratitude, my joy, the exhilaration of being recognized this way,\" he said. \"I haven't been this speechless since The Force Awakens.\" Hamill thanked Lucas, Ford, Disney, and his family, and recounted his journey from childhood puppet shows to working actor. But he saved a special tribute for the Star Wars faithful.\n\n\"You are with me through thick and thin, and the highs and lows, and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"From Jedi to Joker and back again, it's been a fantastic ride.

Over our years together, she's waged some pretty impressive battles. Among her many accomplishments, none is more important or rewarding-to us and to our country-than her accomplishment as a successful mother of 5 and grandmother of 16.\n\nThank you, Ann.\n\nThe other night, from opposite coasts of the country, Ann and I watched President Obama's State of the Union address. Ann figured out pretty fast what was going on. She sent me an email saying that it sounded like he was reading my CPAC speech from last year.\n\nWhat we were hearing was not just a new and improved Barack Obama; it was an entirely different Barack Obama.\n\nSaul Alinsky was out; Jeffrey Immelt was in.\n\nThe President went from \"Change you can believe in\" to \"Can you believe this change?\"\n\nHe sounded like he was going to dig up the First Lady's organic garden to put in a Bob's Big Boy.\n\nBut as the speech went on, it was clear that this was just the appearance of change: His answer for Americans out of work was more government spending and $50 billion for high speed rail.\n\nHe replaced his Chicago politician chief of staff with a fresh face from Chicago, named Daley.\n\nMake no mistake: What we are watching is not Brave New World; what we're watching is Groundhog Day!\n\nTwo years ago, this new President faced an economic crisis and an increasingly uncertain world.\n\nAn uncertain world has been made more dangerous by the lack of clear direction from a weak President. The President who touted his personal experience as giving him special insight into foreign affairs was caught unprepared when Iranian citizens rose up against oppression. His proposed policy of engagement with Iran and North Korea won him the Nobel Peace Prize. How's that worked out? Iran armed Hezbollah and Hamas and is rushing toward nuclear weapons. North Korea fired missiles, tested nukes, sunk a South Korean ship and shelled a South Korean island. And his \"reset program\" with Russia? That consisted of our President abandoning our missile defense in Poland and signing a one-sided nuclear treaty. The cause of liberty cannot endure much more of his \"they get, we give\" diplomacy!\n\nThe world - and our valiant troops - watched in confusion as the President announced that he intended to win the war in Afghanistan....as long as it didn't go much beyond August of 2011. And while the Taliban may not have an air force or sophisticated drones, it's safe to say... they do have calendars.\n\nI surely hope that at some point in the near future, the President will finally be able to construct a foreign policy, any foreign policy.\n\nHere at home, the President's response to the economic crisis was the most expensive failed social experiment in modern history.\n\nHe guaranteed that unemployment wouldn't go beyond 8%. As he watched millions and millions of Americans lose their jobs, lose their homes and lose their hope, his response was this: It could be worse.\n\nIt could be worse? This is the leader of the Free World's answer to the greatest job loss since the Great Depression? What's next? Let them eat cake?\n\nOh, excuse me. Organic cake.\n\nIt's often said that the Presidency of the United States is the toughest job in the world. Fair enough. Undoubtedly true.\n\nBut how difficult is it to take office in the middle of a raging economic crisis and understand that the economy should be your number one priority?\n\nThe President who took office on January 20th, 2009 should have had one central mission - put Americans back to work! Fight for every job! Because every job is a paycheck and paychecks fuel Americans dreams.\n\nWithout a paycheck, you can't take care of your family. Without a paycheck you can't buy school books for your kids, keep a car on the road or help an aging parent make ends meet.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern American history. And that, my friends, is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this President throughout history.\n\nToday there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan ran for President, he hung the Misery Index around Jimmy Carter's neck. Today's misery is real unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. This is the Obama Misery Index-and it's at a record high. It's going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work-it's going to take a new president.\n\nLet me make this very clear. If I decide to run for President, it won't take me two years to wake up to the job crisis threatening America. And I won't be asking Tim Geithner how the economy works-or Larry Summers how to start a business.\n\nFifteen million Americans are out of work. And millions and millions more can't find the good paying jobs they long for and deserve. You've seen the heartbreaking photos and videos of the jobs fairs around the country, where thousands show up to stand in line all day just to have a chance to compete for a few job openings that probably aren't as good as the job they held two years ago. These job fairs and unemployment lines are President Obama's Hoovervilles.\n\nMake no mistake. This is a moral tragedy-a moral tragedy of epic proportion. Unemployment is not just a statistic. Fifteen million unemployed is not just a number. Unemployment means kids can't go to college; that marriages break up under the financial strain; that young people can't find work and start their lives; and men and women in their 50s, in the prime of their lives, fear they will never find a job again. Liberals should be ashamed that they and their policies have failed these good and decent Americans!\n\nThe President is trying to show that he finally gets it-that he really isn't a liberal after all. But his idea of conservative economic policy is to invite some corporate CEO's to the White House for an evening of table-talk.\n\nI'm sorry Mr. President, but that's not a policy, it's a dinner party.\n\nWe've seen the failure of liberal answers before. Liberal welfare policies condemned generations to dependency and poverty. Liberal education policies fail our children today, because they put pensions and privilege for union bosses above the reading scores of our kids. Liberal social policies have failed to protect the unborn. And now, the hollow promises of liberal economic policies have failed to provide millions of Americans with the dignity of work.\n\nUnder the pressure of a crisis, people turn to what they really believe. With our economy in crisis, the President and his fellow liberals turned to Europe for their answers. Like the Europeans, they grew the government, they racked up bigger deficits, they took over healthcare, they pushed cap and trade, they stalled production of our oil and gas and coal, they fought to impose unions on America's workers, and they created over a hundred new agencies and commissions and hundreds of thousands of pages of new regulations. Theirs is a European-style solution to an American problem. It does not work there and it will never work here!\n\nThe right answer is not to believe in European solutions. The right answer is to believe in America-to believe in free enterprise, capitalism, limited government, federalism-and to believe in the constitution, as it was written and intended by the founders.\n\nMy father never graduated from college. He apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On his honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels.\n\nDad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint.\n\nFor my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where free enterprise, small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged and respected. The spirit of enterprise propelled America's economy and our standard of living past every other nation on earth.\n\nI refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. I believe that America is an exceptional nation, of freedom and opportunity and hope. The America I believe in has goodness and a greatness that creates a unique American genius. That genius has blessed the world, led the world and yes, even saved the world from unimaginable darkness.\n\nWe didn't originate the concept of liberty but our Founding Fathers redefined it and shared it with the world. From the brilliant sands of Omaha beach to the dark valleys of the Hindu Kush, we have fought with an unmatched courage and determination, not to conquer territory, but to give others the chance to experience the liberty that is humanity's destiny.\n\nGiven all that America has done to lift others from poverty, given the millions of afflicted we have helped to heal and comfort, and given the hundreds of thousands of lives of America's sons and daughters that have been, and are today, sacrificed to defend freedom, I will not apologize for America!\n\nI don't apologize for America because I believe in America!\n\nWe believe in freedom, in opportunity. We believe in free enterprise and capitalism. We believe in the American dream. And we believe that the principles that made America the leader of the world today are the very principles that will keep America the leader of the world tomorrow.\n\nThese last two years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a couple of years, we have not lost our way.\n\nThis is fundamentally what conservatism is all about. We sing for God to bless America. He already has, he does now and thanks to the greatness of the American people and the principles that guide us, he will do so for generations to come.\n\nBelieve in America. Freedom depends on it.\n\nThank you.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake

every month. We will not share your email address with anyone. Survey Methodology This survey was fielded July 24 -25, 2008 as part of the Hays Research Group Statewide Opinion Counts Survey. 404 completed respondents were interviewed The margin of error for the data collected is +\/- 4.86 % for a 404 response survey for the data analyzed in its entirety with a 95% confidence level; meaning that we can be 95% sure that if every resident of the State with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections was actually surveyed, the results would vary by no more than 4.86% in either direction. The survey sample used was a computer generated random list derived from a database of all households within the State of Alaska with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections. The sample frame was designed to accurately reflect the actual population percentages. Respondents were screened to confirm they were over 18 and each household was attempted at least four times over a period of several days to account for non-response bias. Data was analyzed utilizing SPSS Quancept Software. Interviews were conducted by trained staff with on-site supervision utilizing state of the art computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Random interviews were monitored to assure quality control measures were followed. Dialing results were analyzed daily to assure statistically accurate distribution of call disposition in order to account for \u201cnon-response\u201d variables.

( Here's a handy chart of when the procedure has been used .)Under reconciliation, Democrats would need a simple majority in the Senate to pass legislation, as opposed to the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster.\"They should stop crying about reconciliation as if it's never been done before,\" Reid said.Following Senate Democrats' weekly luncheon, Reid said \"nothing is off the table\" but that \"realistically, they should stop crying about this. It's been done 21 times before.\"\"The question is: Is reconciliation the only way we can do health-care reform?\" he said. \"The answer to that is no.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY), Ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a joint statement today after the U.S. State Department confirmed that Feisal Abdul Rauf, imam of the proposed Ground Zero Mosque in New York City, will travel to the Middle East through a taxpayer-funded program of the International Information Programs Bureau at the State Department. Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King:\n\n\n\nIt is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East.\n\n\n\nAbdul Rauf has cast blame for 9\/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\n\n\nThis radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it.\n\n\n\nThe State Departments selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administrations policy and funding priorities.\n\n\n\nBackground: In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S. He called the attacks a reaction against the U.S. Government politically I wouldn't say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world. In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA.\n\n\n\nNote: On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf a distinguished Muslim cleric and noted that the State Department send[s] people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society.\n\n\n\n######","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324\/http:\/\/republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov:80\/press_display.asp?id=1583","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2757\/4093404710_6aafcfceab_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4014\/4477466276_5b11ff5933_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2462\/4093482522_5ce2eee573_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2719\/4093812806_01cdb20964_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2449\/4092716587_d983ded2c3_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/cdn.printfriendly.com\/pf-icon-small.gif","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov\/img\/btnShare.gif","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2754\/4477474820_464fbb2ee0_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2790\/4093102561_e8eccd6752_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2438\/4093010783_a11ce3045b_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2763\/4476774905_7f7982ec98_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2647\/4093047995_2e369b108d_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2655\/4093048815_216769b8b1_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4049\/4585055608_5f5a0bba17_s.jpg"],"top_img":"","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"","title":"U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs","meta_data":{},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":"Real"},{"id":null,"text":"I came to Washington to fight for a smaller government and get spending under control, not shut the government down. In fact, I have repeatedly voted to fund the government in the last few days.\n\nThe shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.\n\nUnfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge.\n\nI want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is.\n\nShutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding \u2014 it doesn't even touch mandatory funding.\n\nSince its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare.\n\nObamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.\n\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.

Zach Boyden-Holmes, Des Moines Register\n\nChris Soules, the reality television celebrity from Iowa, is set to avoid trial in connection with a deadly crash last year in northeast Iowa after pleading guilty to a reduced charge Tuesday.\n\nIn conjunction with the plea, defense lawyers asserted that the farm tractor Soules' struck while driving his pickup truck, fatally injuring 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora, was improperly lit. Lawyers also revealed new information about injuries Soules sustained.\n\nThe nighttime collision in April 2017 set off over 18 months of high-profile court proceedings, with tabloid media documenting Soules' appearances at a courthouse in Independence, a television reporter charged with a crime for recording video inside a courtroom, and arguments by Soules' lawyers that an Iowa law was unconstitutional.\n\nSoules, the star of the 19th season of ABC's \"The Bachelor,\" was originally charged with a felony for leaving the scene of a deadly accident.\n\n\u25ba UPDATE: Judge denies 'Bachelor' star Chris Soules' request to delay sentencing in fatal 2017 crash\n\n\u25ba PREVIOUSLY: Chris Soules' real life in rural Iowa\n\nHe pleaded guilty Tuesday of leaving the scene of a personal injury accident, which is an aggravated misdemeanor. Rather than a sentence of up to five years in prison, Soules now faces up to two years at his sentencing Jan. 8. He also has the ability to withdraw his guilty plea if a judge does not accept the plea agreement he struck with prosecutors.\n\nIn an affidavit filed Tuesday, Soules' attorney Brandon Brown said that neither Soules nor an independent witness to the crash saw any lights on Mosher's tractor before the collision. By law, the tractor would have been required to display flashing amber lights, the affidavit states.\n\nSoules, 36, was later diagnosed with a concussion resulting from the crash, Brown said. Even though his airbag deployed, it \"did not prevent Mr. Soules from hitting his head on the windshield so hard that it shattered.\"\n\nIn his signed plea, Soules acknowledged he failed to provide his vehicle's registration number to 911 dispatch or law enforcement, as required by Iowa law.\n\nAt his sentencing, Soules will be free to request a deferred judgment or suspended sentence, which would let him avoid prison time and possibly remove the charge from his record.\n\nJudge Andrea Dryer ordered a routine pre-sentence investigation report to be completed ahead of Soules' sentencing.\n\nSoules appeared on \"The Bachelor\" in 2015, where his roots as a farmer in rural Arlington, Iowa, played a prominent role and earned him the nickname, \"Prince Farming.\"\n\nMosher, who was on a tractor without an enclosed cab, was driving as slow as 6 miles per hour, Brown's affidavit states. Soules was driving his truck below the posted 55 mph speed limit, and Brown said experts concluded Soules acted reasonably given the circumstances.\n\n\"Mr. Soules found himself in an unavoidable accident,\" Brown's affidavit states.\n\nSoules called 911 and administered CPR until the compressions caused blood to come from Mosher's mouth. He remained on scene until paramedics arrived and directed them to Mosher, then left several minutes later. Mosher was taken to a local hospital and later died.\n\nAfter the crash, four other individuals arrived at the scene \"nearly immediately,\" according to court documents.\n\n\"No one, even the individuals who knelt in close proximity to Mr. Soules while he administered CPR, smelled any alcohol or had any belief Mr. Soules had been drinking,\" Brown's affidavit states.\n\nSoules' attorneys argued throughout the legal process that a trial would irreparably damage his reputation as a public figure. They also said the law Soules was accused of breaking was invalid because it compromised the constitutional rights of anybody charged under it. Earlier this year they unsuccessfully appealed for the Iowa Supreme Court to take up the case before it went to trial. Last month they said publicly that they were in the process of negotiating a plea.\n\nNeither Soules' attorneys nor Buchanan County Attorney Shawn Harden commented Tuesday. Mosher's family has declined to speak with reporters since the crash.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com\/story\/news\/crime-and-courts\/2018\/11\/13\/abc-bachelor-chris-soules-pleads-guilty-leaving-scene-fatal-crash-killed-kenny-mosher-arlington-iowa\/1975979002\/","images":["https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-play-alt-white.svg","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/8b5dca4c54b24584d95cf15efba87939124804da\/c=0-204-5753-3454\/local\/-\/media\/2017\/11\/27\/IAGroup\/DesMoines\/636473825051305049-112717-Chris-Soules-RWHITE-4920.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-instagram_24.png","https:\/\/media.gannett-cdn.com\/28911775001\/28911775001_5849576645001_5849579232001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001"],"top_img":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/8b5dca4c54b24584d95cf15efba87939124804da\/c=0-204-5753-3454\/local\/-\/media\/2017\/11\/27\/IAGroup\/DesMoines\/636473825051305049-112717-Chris-Soules-RWHITE-4920.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","keywords":[],"authors":["Stephen Gruber-Miller"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com\/story\/news\/crime-and-courts\/2018\/11\/13\/abc-bachelor-chris-soules-pleads-guilty-leaving-scene-fatal-crash-killed-kenny-mosher-arlington-iowa\/1975979002\/","title":"Iowa 'Bachelor' Chris Soules pleads guilty to leaving the scene of an accident","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1","HandheldFriendly":"True","MobileOptimized":320,"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=524153305, app-argument=https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com\/story\/news\/crime-and-courts\/2018\/11\/13\/abc-bachelor-chris-soules-pleads-guilty-leaving-scene-fatal-crash-killed-kenny-mosher-arlington-iowa\/1975979002\/news\/crime-and-courts","theme-color":"#ffffff","og":{"title":"Iowa 'Bachelor' Chris Soules pleads guilty to leaving the scene of an accident","description":"Soules was charged in connection to a fatal 2017 crash that killed 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora.","site_name":"The Des Moines Register","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/8b5dca4c54b24584d95cf15efba87939124804da\/c=0-204-5753-3454\/local\/-\/media\/2017\/11\/27\/IAGroup\/DesMoines\/636473825051305049-112717-Chris-Soules-RWHITE-4920.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","width":1200,"height":675}},"description":"Soules was charged in connection to a fatal 2017 crash that killed 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora.","twitter":{"site":"@DMRegister","creator":"@DMRegister","card":"summary_large_image"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":1542063600.0,"source":"https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com","summary":"","label":"Real"},{"id":null,"text":"Meghan Markle loves her daring gold talon hook earrings from the luxury British jeweler Shaun Leane \u2014 and she\u2019s in fashionable company: models Cara Delevingne, Kendall Jenner and Anja Rubik are also fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very flattered that Meghan wears our work,\u201d Leane tells PEOPLE from his atelier and showroom in London\u2019s Mayfair.\n\nLeane says Meghan, who has made his earrings one of her go-to jewelry pieces in recent months, \u201cis the woman I have in my mind when I design.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe dresses very elegantly, very chic, with very clean lines but with a really nice strong silhouette,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s very confidant.\u201d\n\nThe royal, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry, owns three pieces from the avant-garde jeweler: the Yellow Gold Vermeil Diamond Tusk Bangle ($1281), Yellow Gold Vermeil Serpents Trace Slim Bracelet ($708) and the popular Yellow Gold Vermeil Talon Earrings ($290), all of which were purchased as a gift by Meghan\u2019s close friend Markus Anderson.\n\nMeghan first wore the pieces to the Queen\u2019s 92nd birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall on April, just days after Anderson purchased them.\n\nShe has since worn them on multiple other occasions \u2014 to Charlie van Straubenzee\u2019s wedding in August, at a performance of Hamilton, also in August, and most recently on her royal tour Down Under with Harry.\n\nThe earrings \u2014 which also come in silver, rose gold vermeil and silver black rhodium \u2014 are one of Leane\u2019s signatures, inspired by the jeweler\u2019s 20-year working relationship with the late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen and their shared love of tribal jewelry.\n\n\u201cThe earrings are quite intriguing when they are worn. They make you want to look twice, and I love that reaction,\u201d says Leane.\n\n\u201cThey are elegant and refined,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut there\u2019s an edge.\u201d\n\nLeane has accessorized celebrities such as Adele, Cameron Diaz, Kate Moss and Uma Thurman in his 35-year career. But nothing compares to the \u201cMeghan Markle effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dressed a lot of people, but the effect of dressing someone like Meghan is unbelievable \u2014 it\u2019s amazing and it\u2019s a real honor,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile the talon earrings are consistently a bestseller for his brand, after Meghan was photographed in them they sold six-months worth of stock in just four weeks, Leane says. \u201cWith Meghan, it\u2019s on another level. It opens you up to a whole new demographic because she is on the global stage.\u201d\n\nLeane says he doesn\u2019t see her sartorial power diminishing anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI think she considers what she wears for each event very well,\u201d he says, \u201cand she really does have a great eye.\u201d\n\nFor Black Friday, Leane\u2019s eponymous retailer is offering 20 percent off all purchases

Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n\nDavid Matthews, the father-in-law of Duchess Kate's sister Pippa Middleton, was arrested by French police earlier this week and charged with the rape of a minor in the late 1990s, the Agence France Press wire service and British newspaper The Telegraph reported Friday.\n\nAccording to those two outlets, Matthews, 74, was taken into custody Tuesday at Paris' Orly Airport and questioned by officers from the Protection of Minors Brigade.\n\nA Parisian judicial official confirmed his arrest to The Telegraph.\n\nOn Thursday, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation and a magistrate charged Matthews with raping a female minor.\n\nThe official who spoke to The Telegraph said Matthews' alleged crimes were committed in 1998 and 1999. The newspaper reported that he \"strenuously denied the allegations.\"\n\n\u201cThe investigations will now continue as a judicial investigation and will be led by an investigating judge,\" the official told The Telegraph, adding that he has been released from custody and has not been ordered to remain in France.\n\nWho is David Matthews?\n\nThe son of a coal miner, Matthews worked his way up from mechanic to racecar driver. After a horrific crash at Britain's Silverstone track in 1973, he retired and poured his efforts into his car dealership, which he sold in 1991 in favor of property development.\n\nHe then bought and rehabbed the Eden Roc hotel on the Carribean island of St. Barths, eventually building it into a glitzy, celeb-friendly haunt. However, the resort suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.\n\nHe and his second wife, the Zimbabwe-born Jane Parker (whom he married in the 1970s), divide their time between their two British estates: Caunton Manor, a 30-acre spread in Nottinghamshire, and Glen Affric, a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland.\n\nTheir eldest son James, 42, followed David into the race car business before moving into securities trading. He married Middleton, 34, in a lavish May 2017 ceremony attended by her older sister, the Duchess Kate of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, his brother Prince Harry and his future fianc\u00e9e, American actress Meghan Markle, who attended the reception. Will and Kate's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, served as a page boy and flower girl in the ceremony.\n\nDue to the hour at which the story broke, Kensington Palace, which represents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nThe Matthews' middle son, Michael, a derivatives trader, died at age 22 while descending Mt. Everest in 1999, after becoming the youngest Briton to summit the world's highest peak. The Matthews family created an education foundation in his memory.\n\nYoungest son Spencer, 28, is a reality TV star whose credits include Made in Chelsea, The Bachelor and I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out of Here!\n\nMatthews also has a daughter, Nina, from his first marriage to fellow racecar driver Anita Taylor.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2018\/03\/30\/pippa-middletons-father-law-david-matthews-arrested-charge-raping-minor-1990-s\/474647002\/","images":["https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-play-alt-white.svg","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/54fd27fbca41e7c5199637970607e0e15d1cd62f\/c=0-0-2061-1165\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-instagram_24.png","http:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/53616e9bf9bdd8c1be7b755f02ccfdb1ab42f52b\/c=0-0-2061-1165&r=1280x720\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg"],"top_img":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/54fd27fbca41e7c5199637970607e0e15d1cd62f\/c=0-0-2061-1165\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","keywords":[],"authors":["Jayme Deerwester"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2018\/03\/30\/pippa-middletons-father-law-david-matthews-arrested-charge-raping-minor-1990-s\/474647002\/","title":"Pippa Middleton's father-in-law David Matthews arrested on charge of raping minor in 1990s","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1","HandheldFriendly":"True","MobileOptimized":320,"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=504631398, app-argument=https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2018\/03\/30\/pippa-middletons-father-law-david-matthews-arrested-charge-raping-minor-1990-s\/474647002\/life\/people","theme-color":"#ffffff","og":{"type":"article","title":"Pippa Middleton's father-in-law David Matthews arrested on charge of raping minor in 1990s","description":"David Matthews, whose son James is married to Duchess Kate's sister, was arrested Tuesday in Paris and charged with raping a minor in the 1990s.","site_name":"USA TODAY","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/54fd27fbca41e7c5199637970607e0e15d1cd62f\/c=0-0-2061-1165\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","width":1200,"height":675}},"article":{"content_tier":"free","opinion":"false"},"fb":{"pages":13652355666},"description":"David Matthews, whose son James is married to Duchess Kate's sister, was arrested Tuesday in Paris and charged with raping a minor in the 1990s.","twitter":{"site":"@usatoday","creator":"@usatoday","card":"summary_large_image"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":1522360800.0,"source":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com","summary":"","label":"Real"},{"id":null,"text":"Somebody grab the tissues!\n\nEleven years after the death of Steve Irwin, his legacy lives on through his children, Bindi, 19, and Robert, 14. During Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, a moving clip aired for the Irwin family\u2019s new Animal Planet series, which featured Steve reflecting on his passion for wildlife conservation and his family\u2019s involvement.\n\nHis daughter Bindi shared the truly moving video of her late father to Twitter.\n\n\u201cMy first time watching this footage was only a few days ago,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to describe the amount of emotion in my heart once the video ended. My dad. My superhero. I promise to do my best to make you proud and ensure your legacy lives on forever.\u201d\n\nThe video features a visibly emotional Steve talking about his children, saying, \u201cIs there anything in this world that would want to make me give away what I\u2019m doing now? Yes, there is. When my children can take the football that I call wildlife conservation and run it up. When they\u2019re ready to run up our mission, I\u2019ll gladly step aside, and I guarantee you it will be the proudest moment of my life.\u201d\n\nChoking back tears, Steve continued, \u201cThen and only then will I know that I have achieved my ultimate goal, to be able to stand aside and let them run up my mission.\u201d\n\nFellow Aussie, Russell Crowe, also tweeted the footage, writing, \u201cAh, talk about a Super Bowl day moment\u2026 what a top bloke\u2026 tough as nails, heart on his sleeve, never a wasted breath, full of love and man could he make me laugh.\u201d\n\nBindi, who was only eight years old when her father died, and her younger brother, Robert, have indeed continued their father\u2019s work in wildlife conservation. They work with all kinds of animals at the Australia Zoo alongside their mother, Terri Irwin.\n\nBindi previously opened up on the Today show about how she honors the Crocodile Hunter star's memory, saying, \u201cWe do want to carry on in dad\u2019s footsteps, and make sure everything he worked so hard for continues on.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s series will premiere on the Animal Planet in the fall 2018. Steve\u2019s show, The Crocodile Hunter, aired on the Animal Planet from 1996 to 2007.\n\nFor more from the Irwins, watch the clip below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids","images":["https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/120x120\/public\/images\/2018-01\/robert_irwin_gettyimages-693573876.jpg?h=a5d655c8&width=256&quality=75","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","data:image\/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27\/%3e","https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/1280x720\/public\/images\/2018-02\/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c","https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/120x120\/public\/images\/2017-10\/bindi_terri_robert_irwin_instagram.jpg?h=8fc73106&width=256&quality=75","data:image\/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27\/%3e","https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/640x360\/public\/images\/2018-02\/pink_willow_getty914303898.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80","https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/120x120\/public\/images\/2018-01\/irwin_family.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75"],"top_img":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/1280x720\/public\/images\/2018-02\/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids","title":"Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width","apple-mobile-web-app-capable":"yes","google-site-verification":"hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w","og":{"image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/1280x720\/public\/images\/2018-02\/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c","width":1280,"height":720},"description":"In the clip, which aired during the Super Bowl, Steve talks about handing over his mission to his kids.","title":"Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids","site_name":"Entertainment Tonight","url":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids","type":"Article"},"description":"In the clip, which aired during the Super Bowl, Steve talks about handing over his mission to his kids.","twitter":{"description":"In the clip, which aired during the Super Bowl, Steve talks about handing over his mission to his kids.","title":"Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids","site":{"identifier":"@etnow","id":23603092},"url":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids","card":"summary_large_image","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/1280x720\/public\/images\/2018-02\/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c","width":1280,"height":720},"creator":"@etnow"},"title":"Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids | Entertainment Tonight","fb":{"pages":106843036179,"admins":3111204,"app_id":145337045558621},"article":{"opinion":"false"},"keywords":"Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Super Bowl, Bindi Irwin","robots":"max-image-preview:large","next-head-count":39,"msapplication-TileImage":"\/img\/favicons\/ms-icon-144x144.png","theme-color":"#fff","msapplication-TileColor":"#fd005b"},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com","summary":"","label":"Real"},{"id":null,"text":"Teen Mom OG star Ryan Edwards\u2018 wife Mackenzie Standifer Edwards celebrated Halloween with a very special little pumpkin by her side!\n\nIn celebration of the spooky holiday on Wednesday, Mackenzie shared a smiling photo of herself standing beside 10-year-old stepson Bentley \u2014 dressed up in a No. 24 football uniform, which he also wore last year \u2014 and a stroller carrying her little one, whose face is covered by a pumpkin emoji.\n\nShe also gave an update on her husband, who checked into rehab earlier this month, according to Us Weekly.\n\nWhen an Instagram user asked if Ryan was still in rehab, Mackenzie said, \u201cHe is doing SO good.

But to celebrate the year's most romantic day, a Virgin Atlantic flight went not one but 100 extra miles.A Virgin Atlantic flight took off from London's Gatwick Airport and flew to UK's southwest coast to draw a heart-shaped flight course on the occasion of Valentine's Day. The Airbus A330 plane took off from London at 11.30am and spent about two hours creating a Valentine-appropriate heart-shaped flight path measuring about 100 miles in length.The unique flight path was spotted by air traffic monitoring portal \"Flight radar 24\" which shared a screenshot of the flight's route.However, some people Twitter were not impressed with Virgin Atlantic's Valentine's Day gimmick and called out the airline for wasting aviation fuel and causing possible delays. Responding to people's concerns, the airline clarified that the flight was for training purposes.\"This was a required training flight that happened to take place on Valentines Day, so we altered the

O\u2019Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That\u2019s when the \u201ctolerant\u201d liberals got violent.\n\nOne of the men grabbed O\u2019Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.\n\nO\u2019Reilly was taken to St. Vincent\u2019s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.\n\nThe family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O\u2019Reilly \u201cgot what he deserved\u201d for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.\n\nLiberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don\u2019t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be \u201ctortured,\u201d but it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he\u2019s done.\n\nLiberalism is truly a mental disorder.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933\/http:\/\/usleader.net:80\/index.php\/2017\/05\/11\/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals\/","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Clipboard01-2.jpg"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/index.php\/2017\/05\/11\/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals\/","title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","description":"Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was","robots":"noodp","og":{"locale":"en_US","type":"article","title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","description":"Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/index.php\/2017\/05\/11\/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals\/","site_name":"US Leader","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg","width":678,"height":381}},"article":{"tag":"Critical","section":"POLITICS","published_time":"2017-05-11T15:58:29+00:00"},"twitter":{"card":"summary","description":"Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was","title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg"},"generator":"WordPress 4.7.4","ca_title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","ca_image":"http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1-150x150.jpg"},"movies":[],"publish_date":1494453600.0,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":"Fake"},{"id":null,"text":"Illegal aliens residing in the state of California in defiance of federal immigration laws would now be able to serve on all state and local boards and commissions under a proposal introduced before the California state Senate. Now the state of California has appointed its first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.\n\nThe committee\u2019s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful \u2014 the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or \u201cCal-SOAP,\u201d for short \u2014 but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to college\n\nMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.\n\nMateo said via Fox News \u2013 \u201cWhile undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 174 made Mateo\u2019s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,\u201d Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill\u2019s author said in a statement. \u201cUndocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can\u2019t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De Le\u00f3n\u2019s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo\u2019s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.\n\nMateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting \u2013 In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w\/ my same background did. I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value. I hope to do the same w\/ @StudentAidCommission. #undocumentedunafraid.Thank you Sen. @ kdeleon for appointing me to the CalSOAP Advisory Committee. I look forward to working w\/ the rest of the committee & the Student Aid Commission in such important task \u2013 increase the accessibility of postsecondary education opportunities for low-income students. Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty. In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish \u2013\n\n\u201cEverything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.\u201d\n\nIf she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.\n\nIt is important to note that while Mateo is the first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.\n\nMany were also quick to point out Mateo\u2019s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions \u2013 \u201cAs someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.\u201d\n\nCiting EdSource data, de Leon\u2019s office said an estimated 72,300 undocumented students are enrolled in California\u2019s public colleges and universities. (Of those, about 60,000 attend community colleges, 8,300 are in the California State University system and 4,000 are on University of California campuses.)

She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.\n\nNow the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that \u201cOver Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.\u201d\n\nKnown in some circles as \u201cthe Poverty Pimp,\u201d Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda\u2019s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.\n\nEven today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.\n\nOn top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.\n\nWhile the word \u201ccolor\u201d may have been been \u201cCongress\u201d since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.\n\nThen again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.\n\nThankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.\n\nStill, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.\n\nCome to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!\n\nSources: Teddy Stick \u2013 1tch","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/democrat-maxine-waters-has-shown-up-to-only-10-of-congressional-meetings-for-35-years\/","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2015-08-CCGS_Amundsen2-1200x800.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/de-blasio-signing-law.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/o-elizabeth-warren-facebook.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/^04312FC568BA746282EB1DC7D3F82AC0BEC391093CAF2DFCBD^pimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-10-16-at-11.51.35-PM.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/London_fire_pkg_848x480_966863939673.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Planned-Parenthood-1.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/104527322-GettyImages-695658752-jeff-sessions.530x298.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/hqdefault-1.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/newsletter-join.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Muslim-college.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/04312FC568BA746282EB1DC7D3F82AC0BEC391093CAF2DFCBDpimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/636307298697469912-GRAHAM.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/standing-png-100-height.png"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/04312FC568BA746282EB1DC7D3F82AC0BEC391093CAF2DFCBDpimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/democrat-maxine-waters-has-shown-up-to-only-10-of-congressional-meetings-for-35-years\/","title":"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0","og":{"locale":"en_US","type":"article","title":"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS","description":"CLICK HERE","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/democrat-maxine-waters-has-shown-up-to-only-10-of-congressional-meetings-for-35-years\/","site_name":"Teddy Stick","updated_time":"2017-06-07T19:27:43+00:00","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170614175731im_\/https:\/\/teddystick.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/04312FC568BA746282EB1DC7D3F82AC0BEC391093CAF2DFCBDpimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg","width":600,"height":300}},"article":{"publisher":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/teddystickofficial\/","author":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/teddystickofficial\/","tag":"There 10%","section":"News","published_time":"2017-06-07T17:31:13+00:00","modified_time":"2017-06-07T19:27:43+00:00"},"twitter":{"card":"summary","description":"Maxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. \u00a0She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor.

We\u2019re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,\u201d Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n\u201cI love the Sixties,\u201d said Trump, continuing, \u201cI was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.\u201d In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. \u201cYou have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We\u2019re not going to give it to them, folks. They\u2019re going to have to earn their citizenship.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won\u2019t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing \u201cman-portable\u201d tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we\u2019re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.\u201d\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option \u201cextremely\u201d liberally. \u201cMy feeling is we have these weapons and we\u2019ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there\u2019s absolutely no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be using them.\u201d\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. \u201cThis guy\u2019s the president of the United States and he\u2019s bowing to the Chinese.

The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless\u201d or \u201cconscientious\u201d electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton\u2019s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation\u2019s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214\/http:\/\/usasnich.com:80\/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president\/","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214im_\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/919-696x364-800x509.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214im_\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/919-696x364.jpg"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214im_\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/919-696x364.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president\/","title":"BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","robots":"noindex,follow","og":{"locale":"en_US","type":"article","title":"BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT","description":"BREAKING!

Rumor has it, the \"La La Land\" actor and the \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" actress have been living separate lives for months following the arrival of their second daughter last year.\n\n\n\n\"They're past the point of caring now. The biggest sign it's over is the fact that Eva and Ryan don't even bother to argue anymore. The only thing they do agree on is the fact that none of their needs are being met!\" says the source.\n\n\n\nAccording to a source, Ryan and Eva's relationship broke up after he chose to celebrate Mother's Day with his mom, Donna, rather than Eva. Their relationship has reportedly been toxic behind closed doors for quite a long time now.\n\n\n\nRyan was devastated when Eva refused to accompany him to the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, despite his Best Actor nods for \"La La Land\", according to sources.\n\n\n\nThe source claims, \"Everyone's kind of gotten used to Eva shunning the limelight, but no one ever thought for a moment she'd skip the Oscars - especially when Ryan was nominated for a once-in-a-lifetime accolade. It didn't make sense. When they first got together, they were inseparable and were often seen out on dates holding hands. Now that just doesn't happen.\"\n\n\n\nEva reportedly refused to accompany Ryan on the annual award shows as she was jealous with his co-star Emma Stone. \"Emma and Ryan have THE hottest chemistry in Hollywood right now. Eva seems to feel totally intimidated by Emma, even though neither Emma nor Ryan have given her any reason to worry,\" shares the source.\n\n\n\n\"Since Eva bowed out of the public eye, she's like a paranoid hermit, and it's driven a huge wedge between them,\" the source tells Radar Online, \"She'll go weeks without speaking to any other adult except Ryan. It makes for a pretty intense situation. Eva won't go out, and she avoids his family. Even worse, she's convinced she's not Ryan's only one - when she is!\"\n\n\n\nThe source adds, \"Ryan's not a cheating kind of guy and can't stand it when women hit on him. Even worse, he can't stand being accused of something he hasn\u2019t done!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 AceShowbiz.com","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake

She will either let her successor Prince Charles take over or Prince Williams will be given the crown.\n\nThere were reports suggesting that Prince of Wales is pursuing the Queen to step down to give him the charge. There were also speculations that her highness wants Prince William and Kate Middleton to take over the throne. Amidst these speculations, a tabloid claims that the Queen is dying and she has decided to let the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take over.\n\nThe report published by Star suggests that William and Kate's reign will begin after baby number 3 while Charles and Camilla will be banished forever. \"In a startling twist, the Duke and Duchess will become the next king and queen, and with Prince Charles cast aside, they're ready to modernise the monarchy,\" the outlet writes.\n\nA palace insider told the magazine that the coronation will happen soon after Kate Middleton's delivery. \"The coronation will happen after Kate has [their third] baby. Shunting Charles aside is an unprecedented break from tradition, but it's the right time to shake things up. Will and Kate are a welcome breath of fresh air, and they're going to do things their own way!\" the source says.\n\nWhile the tabloid over and over repeats that Prince Charles is banished and Queen's decision to choose William and Kate over the immediate successor, the report mentions nothing about \"how\" the couple will rule the throne \u2013 wasn't that the headline in the first place, Star?\n\nThe fluff piece has been called out by Gossip Cop and they confirm that their report is a false story. The Queen has made no such decision and Charles hasn't been \"banished forever from the throne,\" as the report suggests.\n\n\"Our sources at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace that the claims in this latest version are made up,\" Gossip Cop writes.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"www.ibtimes.co.in\/prince-william-kate-middleton-reveal-how-theyll-rule-throne-742940","images":["https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/804294\/rannvijay-elvish.png?w=10&h=6","https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/660766\/queen-elizabeth-prince-charles.jpg?w=10&h=6","https:\/\/g.ibtimes.com\/www\/images\/ibt-logo-2023.svg","https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/804518\/raveena-tandon-celebrates-26-years-bade-miyan-chote-miyan.jpg?w=10&h=6","https:\/\/g.ibtimes.com\/www\/images\/ibt-logo-2023-sm.svg","https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/655632\/kate-middleton-dresses.jpg?w=10&h=6","https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/655632\/kate-middleton-dresses.jpg","https:\/\/graphic1.ibtimes.co.in\/www\/img\/news-positiv_new.png","https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/804506\/hot-mess-shraddha-kapoor-paired-opposite-ranbir-kapoor-dhoom-4-report-details.jpg?w=10&h=6","https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/804513\/nick-jonas-runs-off-stage.png?w=10&h=6"],"top_img":"https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/655632\/kate-middleton-dresses.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":["Dishya Sharma"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.in\/prince-william-kate-middleton-reveal-how-theyll-rule-throne-742940","title":"Prince William, Kate Middleton reveal how they'll rule the throne?","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0","author":"Dishya Sharma","copyright":"2024 IBTimes","subject":"Prince William, Kate Middleton reveal how they'll rule the throne?","description":"Rumours about the Queen stepping down have been making the rounds for quite some time now.","keywords":"who will be the next king,who will be the next queen,Prince William Kate Middleton next King and Queen,Kate middleton replace queen elizabeth,Prince William next king,Prince William Kate Middleton,Queen Elizabeth,Prince Charles,Camilla,Prince Charles banished from throne,Kate Middleton pregnancy","article":{"published_time":"2017-09-21T15:55:38+05:30","modified_time":"2017-09-21T15:55:38+05:30","section":"Royalty","tag":"Kate Middleton pregnancy","publisher":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ibtimes.india"},"og":{"title":"Prince William, Kate Middleton reveal how they'll rule the throne?","url":"https:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.in\/prince-william-kate-middleton-reveal-how-theyll-rule-throne-742940","image":"https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/655632\/kate-middleton-dresses.jpg","description":"Rumours about the Queen stepping down have been making the rounds for quite some time now.","type":"article","site_name":"IBTimes India"},"DC.title":"Prince William, Kate Middleton reveal how they'll rule the throne?","DC.description":"Rumours about the Queen stepping down have been making the rounds for quite some time now.","DC.subject":"who will be the next king,who will be the next queen,Prince William Kate Middleton next King and Queen,Kate middleton replace queen elizabeth,Prince William next king,Prince William Kate Middleton,Queen Elizabeth,Prince Charles,Camilla,Prince Charles banished from throne,Kate Middleton pregnancy","news_keywords":"Royalty,Who will be the next king,Who will be the next queen,Prince William Kate Middleton next King and Queen,Kate middleton replace queen elizabeth,Prince William next king,Prince William Kate Middleton,Queen Elizabeth,Prince Charles,Camilla,Prince Charles banished from throne,Kate Middleton pregnancy","syndication-source":"https:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.in\/prince-william-kate-middleton-reveal-how-theyll-rule-throne-742940","Googlebot-news":"index, follow","robots":"index, follow","twitter":{"title":"Prince William, Kate Middleton reveal how they'll rule the throne?","description":"Rumours about the Queen stepping down have been making the rounds for quite some time now.","image":"https:\/\/data1.ibtimes.co.in\/en\/full\/655632\/kate-middleton-dresses.jpg","card":"summary_large_image","site":"@ibtimes_india","domain":"www.ibtimes.co.in","url":"https:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.in\/prince-william-kate-middleton-reveal-how-theyll-rule-throne-742940"},"fb":{"pages":134755750024728,"app_id":1386147698272496},"theme-color":"#000000"},"movies":[],"publish_date":1505989538.0,"source":"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.in","summary":"","label":"Fake"},{"id":null,"text":"Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet \u2014 Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.\n\nFor some celebrities, this would not be a big deal \u2014 some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as \u201csources\u201d and \u201cinsiders\u201d dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.\n\nAfter all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.\n\nSo the decision to keep Kylie\u2019s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.\n\nThe non-confirmation of the news \u2014 reported by the tabloids in September and described as a \u201chappy\u201d surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott \u2014 has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family\u2019s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie\u2019s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.\n\nMeanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie\u2019s first public appearance since the fall, although she\u2019s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as \u201cWe\u2019re Expecting!\u201d (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)\n\nToday in Creative Ways Kylie Jenner Has Hidden Her Pregnancy for Fashion Jobs: a baby lamb in @THELOVEMAGAZINE! pic.twitter.com\/vyu7vmgIdu \u2014 Alyssa Vingan (@alyssavingan) January 29, 2018\n\nShould Kylie\u2019s baby arrive this month, it will join new cousin Chicago West, Kim and Kanye West\u2019s daughter who was born via surrogate last month. Khloe and her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, are also expecting a baby in March. Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie\u2019s baby\u2019s debut for quite some time.\n\n\u201cShe very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can\u2019t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,\u201d a \u201csource\u201d told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.\u201d","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/arts-and-entertainment\/wp\/2018\/02\/02\/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever\/","images":["https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/style-blog\/files\/2018\/02\/Was8927925_image.jpg&w=1440","http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dr\/resources\/images\/generic-newsletter-signup.png","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/arc-authors\/washpost\/7e725e82-ef74-4705-90dc-6b3596c798ec.png&h=196&w=196"],"top_img":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/style-blog\/files\/2018\/02\/Was8927925_image.jpg&w=1440","keywords":[],"authors":["Emily Yahr"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/arts-and-entertainment\/wp\/2018\/02\/02\/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever\/","title":"Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever","meta_data":{"description":"The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family.","og":{"site_name":"Washington Post","type":"article","url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/arts-and-entertainment\/wp\/2018\/02\/02\/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever\/","image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/style-blog\/files\/2018\/02\/Was8927925_image.jpg&w=1440","title":"Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever","description":"The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family."},"og_site_name":"Washington Post","og_type":"article","og_url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/arts-and-entertainment\/wp\/2018\/02\/02\/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever\/","og_image":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/style-blog\/files\/2018\/02\/Was8927925_image.jpg&w=1440","og_title":"Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever","og_description":"The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family.","twitter":{"site":"@WashingtonPost","card":"summary_large_image","title":"Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever","description":"The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family."},"twitter_site":"@WashingtonPost","twitter_card":"summary_large_image","twitter_title":"Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever","twitter_description":"The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family.","last_updated_date":"2021-12-03T05:12:10.126Z","article":{"published_time":"2018-02-02T16:27:40.000Z","modified_time":"2021-12-03T05:12:10.126Z","section":"Arts & Entertainments","content_tier":"metered"},"article_published_time":"2018-02-02T16:27:40.000Z","article_modified_time":"2021-12-03T05:12:10.126Z","article_section":"Arts & Entertainments","article_content_tier":"metered","robots":"max-image-preview:large","viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","next-head-count":86,"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=352509417, app-argument=https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/arts-and-entertainment\/wp\/2018\/02\/02\/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever\/?sourceApp=apple-banner"},"movies":[],"publish_date":1517526000.0,"source":"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com","summary":"","label":"Fake"},{"id":null,"text":"Did Khloe Kardashian just let her daughter\u2019s name slip, with the help of Andy Cohen?!

Well, it\u2019s a joke, but a clever joke at that, that had fans in a tizzy during a Twitter exchange on April 8. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet baby Andy!

In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver.\n\n\u201cNot one of those single things amounts to recklessness,\u201d Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. \u201cBut when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct.\u201d\n\nMohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing.\n\n\u201cIf an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time,\u201d one Mad World News reader commented on the site\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cShe should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness,\u201d another wrote. \u201cMaybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges.

In the Playoffs, Poole averaged 17 points per game and played a key role as the Warriors won their fourth NBA championship in eight years.\n\nThe impact Green\u2019s unprovoked attack will have on the Warriors this year in their defense of the title remains to be seen. The power forward is currently away from the team after coming to a mutual agreement that he would stay away for the forseeable future.\n\nMany NBA betting sites have the Warriors as the favourites to win the Western Conference and NBA Championship this season, but the dynamic could change following this recent scandal. Green is in the final year of his contract with the Warriors and is looking for the last big deal of his career; something the franchise may not be inclined to reward him with following this latest bout of indiscipline.\n\nA trade could still be on the cards, but it appears that the Warriors are committed to building around Poole in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he\u2019s in this position, about to sign a big (contract) extension \u2013 hopefully,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr after his first preseason appearance since the debacle. \u201cThe guy is tough. He\u2019s mentally tough. He\u2019s physically tough. He\u2019s ultra-confident in his game, and he showed it tonight.\u201d\n\nOne of the best betting sites, SportsBetting.ag, currently have Poole as the favorite to win the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award this season. Shooting guards have won this award in 16 of the last 18 seasons in the NBA, with bucket getters being the profile of player that the voters tend to go for.\n\nThe reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Tyler Herro, is a similar profile of player to Poole and both players are anticipated to sign comparible extensions with the franchises that drafted them in 2019. However, Herro has dropped to +1200 to retain his crown after he started during his only appearance in Miami\u2019s preseason schedule.\n\nPoole was ruled out of the running for Sixth Man of the Year last year after starting too many games to match the criteria due to Thompson\u2019s injury. Now that one half of the splash brothers is back healthy, Poole should return to his place as the first man of the bench while Thompson and Andrew Wiggins occupy the wing positions.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget narrative in all of this. Many NBA awards are won based on the narrative surrounding a player\u2019s season, and as much as Poole wouldn\u2019t have wanted this incident to happen, it will almost certainly lead to support in his corner.","HS":null,"TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":"fake news","url":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/cnn-ratings-plunge-30-percent\/","images":["https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/themes\/joints-wp-master\/assets\/images\/blank.gif"],"top_img":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/jordan-poole-300-to-win-nba-sixth-man-of-the-year","title":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui","description":"If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.","robots":"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large","og":{"locale":"en_GB","type":"article","title":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year - yournewswire","description":"If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.","url":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/jordan-poole-300-to-win-nba-sixth-man-of-the-year","site_name":"yournewswire","updated_time":"2022-10-11T07:35:47+00:00","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","secure_url":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","width":800,"height":400,"alt":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year","type":"image\/jpeg"}},"article":{"section":"General News","published_time":"2022-10-10T15:09:23+00:00","modified_time":"2022-10-11T07:35:47+00:00"},"twitter":{"card":"summary_large_image","title":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year - yournewswire","description":"If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.","image":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","label1":"Written by","data1":"Dustin Williams","label2":"Time to read","data2":"2 minutes"},"msapplication-TileImage":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2024\/08\/cropped-cropped-ImportedPhoto.739916748.369245-270x270.png"},"movies":[],"publish_date":1665414563.0,"source":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com","summary":"","label":"Fake"},{"id":null,"text":"ROCHESTER, New Hampshire \u2013 During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Bill Murray took a moment to praise Rochester, New Hampshire residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:\n\n\u201cWe were just leaving the city limits of Rochester, New Hampshire when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out.

Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent,\" the source claims. \"He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way.\"\n\n\"Angie was in a very bad place after [her] split [from Brad],\" the source adds. \"Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful.\"\n\nThe source says that Pitt has also moved on, and any possibility of him getting back together with Jolie is highly unlikely.\n\n\"People talk about them reuniting, but it will never happen,\" the source tells us. \"Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they've attempted therapy with the [six] children [they share], they can barely be in the same room together.\"\n\nET has reached out to Jolie's rep for comment.\n\nDespite the highly publicized breakup, Jolie appears to be enjoying her day-to-day life. In addition to her job as an actress, filmmaker and humanitarian, the brunette beauty has been spending a lot of quality time with Shiloh, Maddox, Vivienne, Zahara, Pax and Knox, the six kids she shares with Pitt.\n\nEarlier this month, she took a few of them to go see the new Tomb Raider reboot, which stars Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, the iconic role she originally played in 2001's Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and again in 2003 for the sequel, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. She's also been spotted out and about, doing normal, everyday activities, like grocery shopping.\n\nWhile Jolie has seemingly started to become comfortable on her own, Pitt (who's notoriously private), has become a changed man, going out more and enjoying time with close friends, an additional source told ET on Monday.\n\n\"He has made changes in his life since the split,\" the source said. \"When they first split, he spent a lot of time at home and was often very down about what was going on. He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, he\u2019s been going out more. He enjoys going out to eat with close friends.\"\n\n\"He's very private about who he\u2019s seeing, but he does continue to casually date,\" the source added. \"The women he sees are not in the public

ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.\n\nLaunch of the show will extend the presence of \u201cGMA\u201d to the network\u2019s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of \u201cToday.\u201d The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main \u201cGMA\u201d broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.\n\nThe new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace \u201cThe Chew\u201d with the new \u201cGMA\u201d hour.\u201cGood Morning America\u201d enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of \u201cGood Afternoon America\u201d between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.\n\n\u201cGMA\u201d makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival\u201cToday\u201d remains intense. \u201cGood Morning America\u201d remains TV\u2019s most-watched morning program, but \u201cToday, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, \u201cToday\u201d has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while \u201cGMA\u201d has notched 63,000 more viewers than \u201cToday\u201d overall.\n\nThe expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, \u201cGMA\u201d launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped \u201cGMA\u201d website that was not tied to ABC News\u2019 content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, \u201cGMA\u2019 senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. \u201cWe have so much content and a two-hour program isn\u2019t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,\u201d he toldVariety.\n\nHaines will leave \u201cThe View\u201d to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories.
