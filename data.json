Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.\n\nIt is wonderful to be here with all of you.\n\nTo be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.\n\nTo be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.\n\nTo be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.\n\nAnd in a place\u2026 with absolutely no ceilings.\n\nYou know, President Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation\u2019s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nTwo Democrats guided by the \u2014 Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\n\nPresident Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there\u2019s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: \u201cEquality of opportunity\u2026 Jobs for those who can work\u2026 Security for those who need it\u2026 The ending of special privilege for the few\u2026 The preservation of civil liberties for all\u2026 a wider and constantly rising standard of living.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds good to me.\n\nIt\u2019s America\u2019s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.\n\nThat bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.\n\nIt\u2019s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.\n\nIt\u2019s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.\n\nWhen President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.\n\nWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.\n\nWe\u2019re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.\n\nInstead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the end.\n\nAs we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.\n\nYou worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs\u2026 you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again \u2013 going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.\n\nSo we\u2019re standing again. But, we all know we\u2019re not yet running the way America should.\n\nYou see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.\n\nWhile many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\u2019s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.\n\nSo, you have to wonder: \u201cWhen does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\nI say now.\n\nProsperity can\u2019t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.\n\nDemocracy can\u2019t be just for billionaires and corporations.\n\nProsperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.\n\nYou brought our country back.\n\nNow it\u2019s time \u2014 your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\n\nAnd, you know what?\n\nAmerica can\u2019t succeed unless you succeed.\n\nThat is why I am running for President of the United States.\n\nHere, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.\n\nI\u2019m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.\n\nFor the successful and the struggling.\n\nFor the innovators and inventors.\n\nFor those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.\n\nFor the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.\n\nFor the nurses who work the night shift.\n\nFor the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.\n\nFor the veterans who served our country.\n\nFor the small business owners who took a risk.\n\nFor everyone who\u2019s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\n\nI\u2019m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.\n\nOur country\u2019s challenges didn\u2019t begin with the Great Recession and they won\u2019t end with the recovery.\n\nFor decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.\n\nAdvances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.\n\nThe financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value\u2026 too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.\n\nOur political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they\u2019ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.\n\nNow, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we\u2019ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.\n\nOur next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that \u2014 to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.\n\nAt our best, that\u2019s what Americans do. We\u2019re problem solvers, not deniers. We don\u2019t hide from change, we harness it.\n\nBut we can\u2019t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.\n\nAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.\n\nNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\u2019re all singing the same old song\u2026\n\nA song called \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nYou know the one \u2014 all our troubles look as though they\u2019re here to stay\u2026 and we need a place to hide away\u2026 They believe in yesterday.\n\nAnd you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try singing that, too, I\u2019ll tell you!\n\nThese Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.\n\nAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\u2019ll say: \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d Well, then, why don\u2019t they start listening to those who are?\n\nThey pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.\n\nThey want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.\n\nThey shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.\n\nThey want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.\n\nAnd they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.\n\nFundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called \u201ca village\u201d that has a place for everyone.\n\nNow, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.\n\nI believe that success isn\u2019t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty\u2026\n\nHow many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive\u2026\n\nHow many young people go to college without drowning in debt\u2026\n\nHow many people find a good job\u2026\n\nHow many families get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nI didn\u2019t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.\n\nMy mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.\n\nHer own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.\n\nYou know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.\n\nThe 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.\n\nThe woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.\n\nAnd, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.\n\nTo meet every challenge.\n\nTo be resilient\u2026 no matter what the world throws at you.\n\nTo solve the toughest problems.\n\nI believe we can do all these things because I\u2019ve seen it happen.\n\nAs a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.\n\nMy first job out of law school was for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn\u2019t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.\n\nAs a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.\n\nIn Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.\n\nAs Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9\/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.\n\nIt took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.\n\nThere are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.\n\nJust weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn\u2019t quite so hard for families like hers?\n\nI want to be her champion and your champion.\n\nIf you\u2019ll give me the chance, I\u2019ll wage and win Four Fights for you.\n\nThe first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\n\nTo make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.\n\nThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nIs this possible in today\u2019s world?\n\nI believe it is or I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\n\nDo I think it will be easy? Of course not.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can\u2019t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.\n\nThere are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.\n\nBusiness leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.\n\nThere are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.\n\nThere are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow\u2019s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\u2019ll propose specific policies to:\n\nReward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck \u2013 because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.\n\nI will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.\n\nI will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.\n\nWe will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.\n\nWe will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.\n\nAnd we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\n\nDeveloping renewable power \u2013 wind, solar, advanced biofuels\u2026\n\nBuilding cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings\u2026\n\nUsing additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment\u2026\n\nAnd ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.\n\nNow, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.\n\nWe will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.\n\nWe will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.\n\nNow, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.\n\nThat\u2019s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.\n\nAnd I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that talent is universal \u2013 you can find it anywhere \u2013 but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.\n\nOur country won\u2019t be competitive or fair if we don\u2019t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.\n\nSo let\u2019s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.\n\nLet\u2019s make college affordable and available to all \u2026and lift the crushing burden of student debt.\n\nLet\u2019s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.\n\nNow, the second fight is to strengthen America\u2019s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.\n\nAnd today\u2019s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.\n\nI believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.\n\nI believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.\n\nI believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.\n\nThat you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.\n\nI believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.\n\nAnd it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job \u2014 and women of color often making even less.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.\n\nIn America, every family should feel like they belong.\n\nSo we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.\n\nAnd, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.\n\nYou know, America\u2019s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what\u2019s drawn so many to our shores. What\u2019s inspired people all over the world. I know. I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\n\nAnd these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.\n\nSo we have a third fight: to harness all of America\u2019s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.\n\nNo other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran \u2013 and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.\n\nNo other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.\n\nAs your President, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.\n\nAnd if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.\n\nAs a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today\u2019s threats and tomorrow\u2019s.\n\nAnd when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I\u2019ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they\u2019ve earned.\n\nI\u2019ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.\n\nBut, I know \u2014 I know we have to be smart as well as strong.\n\nMeeting today\u2019s global challenges requires every element of America\u2019s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.\n\nThere are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there\u2019s a lot of good news out there too.\n\nI believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.\n\nAnd we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That\u2019s why we have to win the fourth fight \u2013 reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.\n\nWe have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.\n\nWe need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\u2019s right to vote, rather than every corporation\u2019s right to buy elections.\n\nIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nI want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.\n\nI\u2019ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.\n\nWhat part of democracy are they afraid of?\n\nNo matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.\n\nGovernment is never going to have all the answers \u2013 but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.\n\nThat means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.\n\nWe need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.\n\nTo do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I\u2019ll also stand my ground when I must.\n\nThat\u2019s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State \u2014 whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities \u2014 and it\u2019s something I will always do as your President.\n\nWe Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other\u2019s back.\n\nLike any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.\n\nPeople all over the world have asked me: \u201cHow could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?\u201d\n\nNow, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled \u2013 even killed \u2013 not hired as Secretary of State.\n\nBut President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That\u2019s how we do it in America.\n\nWith that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.\n\nWe can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.\n\nWe can strengthen our families.\n\nWe can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.\n\nAnd we can renew the promise of our democracy.\n\nIf we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.\n\nI want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.\n\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.\n\nText \u201cJOIN\u201d J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6.\n\nGo to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I\u2019m not stopping now.\n\nYou know, I know how hard this job is. I\u2019ve seen it up close and personal.\n\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.\n\nWell, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!\n\nAnd the first grandmother as well.\n\nAnd one additional advantage: You\u2019re won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\u2019ve been coloring it for years!\n\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I\u2019m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.\n\nAnd along the way, I\u2019ll just let you in on this little secret. I won\u2019t get everything right. Lord knows I\u2019ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there\u2019s no shortage of people pointing them out!\n\nAnd I certainly haven\u2019t won every battle I\u2019ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.\n\nI think you know by now that I\u2019ve been called many things by many people \u2014 \u201cquitter\u201d is not one of them.\n\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.\n\nWhen I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I\u2019d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\n\nI can still hear her saying: \u201cLife\u2019s not about what happens to you, it\u2019s about what you do with what happens to you \u2013 so get back out there.\u201d\n\nShe lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century \u2014 all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.\n\nShe was born on June 4, 1919 \u2014 before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.\n\nThe story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us \u2013 not just some, but all \u2013 should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.\n\nNot only because we\u2019re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we\u2019re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.\n\nI wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.\n\nI wish she could have seen the America we\u2019re going to build together.\n\nAn America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.\n\nWhere we don\u2019t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.\n\nAn America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.\n\nThank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","images":["https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"],"top_img":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1","keywords":[],"authors":["Sam Frizell"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","headline":"Hillary Clinton Transcript: Read Full Text of Clinton Campaign Launch","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","theme-color":"#e90606","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","application-name":"nextgen","author":"Sam Frizell","creator":"Sam Frizell","category":"Politics","fb":{"app_id":991230477954201,"pages":10606591490},"article":{"opinion":"false","content_tier":"free","published_time":"2015-06-13T18:32:48"},"pinterest":{"url":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","media":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"},"amphtml":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/?amp=true","format-detection":"telephone=no","og":{"title":"Read the full text of Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","url":"https:\/\/time.com\/3920332\/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch\/","site_name":"TIME","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1","width":1200,"height":628},"type":"article"},"twitter":{"card":"summary_large_image","site":"@TIME","title":"Read the full text of Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech","description":"Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday","image":"https:\/\/api.time.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"http:\/\/time.com","summary":"","label":[1],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"Alaska Statewide 'Opinion Counts' Survey Results Survey conducted 7\/24\/08 - 7\/25\/08 Remember to click here and add your email address to our new mailing list and receive survey results in your mailbox every month. We will not share your email address with anyone. Survey Methodology This survey was fielded July 24 -25, 2008 as part of the Hays Research Group Statewide Opinion Counts Survey. 404 completed respondents were interviewed The margin of error for the data collected is +\/- 4.86 % for a 404 response survey for the data analyzed in its entirety with a 95% confidence level; meaning that we can be 95% sure that if every resident of the State with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections was actually surveyed, the results would vary by no more than 4.86% in either direction. The survey sample used was a computer generated random list derived from a database of all households within the State of Alaska with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections. The sample frame was designed to accurately reflect the actual population percentages. Respondents were screened to confirm they were over 18 and each household was attempted at least four times over a period of several days to account for non-response bias. Data was analyzed utilizing SPSS Quancept Software. Interviews were conducted by trained staff with on-site supervision utilizing state of the art computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Random interviews were monitored to assure quality control measures were followed. Dialing results were analyzed daily to assure statistically accurate distribution of call disposition in order to account for \u201cnon-response\u201d variables.

Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014.\n\nRank\tCause of death\tNumber of deaths\tNumber gun-related\n1st\tHomicide\t2,416\t2,256\n2nd\tUnintentional injuries\t1,135\t47\n3rd\tSuicide\t448\t230\n4th\tHeart disease\t172\t--\n5th\tCancer\t161\t--\n6th\tHIV\t52\t--\n7th\tChronic lower respiratory diseases\t47\t--\n8th\tCongenital anomalies\t38\t--\n9th\tAnemia\t33\t--\n10th\tDiabetes\t33\t--\n\nTotal, 2nd through 9th place\n\n--\n\n2,119\n\n--\n\nSo even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton\u2019s statement correct.\n\nIf you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.\n\nThere were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.\n\nWe should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.\n\nThat said, we think Clinton\u2019s definition of \"young\" as 15-24 is a reasonable one.\n\nOur ruling\n\nClinton said, \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\"\n\nAs long as you define \"young\" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton\u2019s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador \u2014 among other parts of Central America \u2014 Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms.\n\n\u201cAll the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime,\u201d Cuellar told a group of reporters. \u201dThe only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\u201d\n\nCuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with \u201ca little bit of experience\u201d \u2014 a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican \u2014 would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol.\n\nObama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking.\n\nBut most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. \u201cI think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him.\u201d\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday \u2014 and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law.\n\nHe said he had \u201csuspected all along\u201d that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obama\u2019s pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a position that protects children,\u201d Grijalva said, \u201cand a Republican effort \u2026 to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com:80\/218\/immigration-news-congress-changes-to-trafficking-law\/?dcz=","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/02\/218_FinalThreeBloggers.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714-445x304.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6036424&cv=2.0&cj=1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/cdn.rollcall.com\/media\/ui\/pwLogoOverlay.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/themes\/rollcall-blog-regular\/images\/comments-balloon-icon-mini.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/themes\/rollcall-blog-regular\/images\/RC_logo-200px_horz.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/wp-content\/themes\/rollcall-blog-regular\/images\/comments-balloon-icon-mini.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714.jpg?resize=445%2C304"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714-445x304.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":["Brenda Huddleston","Charlene Weshley"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/immigration-news-congress-changes-to-trafficking-law\/","headline":"Immigration News: Congress Eyes Changes to Trafficking Law","meta_data":{"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=433753469","description":"A Republican task force responding to immigration news amid the child migrant crisis is recommending Congress revisit a 2008 trafficking law.","twitter":{"card":"summary","site":"@","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/goppers\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/05\/goppers-header-logo-faceless.png","description":"A Republican task force responding to immigration news amid the child migrant crisis is recommending Congress revisit a 2008 trafficking law."},"og":{"locale":"en_US","title":"Immigration News: Congress Eyes Changes to Trafficking Law","description":"A Republican task force responding to immigration news amid the child migrant crisis is recommending Congress revisit a 2008 trafficking law.","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/immigration-news-congress-changes-to-trafficking-law\/","site_name":218,"type":"article","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140715194931im_\/http:\/\/blogs.rollcall.com\/218\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2014\/07\/immigration005_070714-445x304.jpg"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":[1],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming.\n\nThe ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing.\n\n\"John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,\" the narrator says.\n\nThe stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam.\n\n\"Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.\"\n\nWith images such as a newspaper headline that says \"McCain climate views clash with GOP,\" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change.\n\nIndeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights.\n\nWhen he introduced the bill, McCain called it \"the first comprehensive piece of legislation\" in capping emissions.\n\n\"The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \"It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.\"\n\nBy contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change.\n\nManik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9\/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in \"educating the Senate\" about how government could respond to global warming.\n\n\"It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,\" Roy said.\n\nHe called McCain \"a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.\"\n\nAnd so we find McCain's statement to be True.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

As the \"greatest generation\" did before us, we must move beyond political camps to unite around bold actions in order to build a strong America and a safer world. We must strengthen our military and economy, achieve energy independence, reenergize civilian and interagency capabilities, and revitalize our alliances. Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTopics:\n\nU.S. policy and politics\n\nNational security and defense\n\nWASHINGTON DIVIDED Less than six years after 9\/11, Washington is as divided and conflicted over foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously declared that \"politics stops at the water's edge\"; today, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declares that our major political parties should carry out two separate foreign policies. The Senate unanimously confirmed General David Petraeus, who pledged to implement a new strategy, as the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Yet just weeks later, the Senate began crafting legislation specifically designed to stop that new strategy. More broadly, lines have been drawn between those labeled \"realists\" and those labeled \"neoconservatives.\" Yet these terms mean little when even the most committed neoconservative recognizes that any successful policy must be grounded in reality and even the most hardened realist admits that much of the United States' power and influence stems from its values and ideals. In the midst of these divisions, the American people -- and many others around the world -- have increasing doubts about the United States' direction and role in the world. Indeed, it seems that concern about Washington's divisiveness and capability to meet today's challenges is the one thing that unites us all. We need new thinking on foreign policy and an overarching strategy that can unite the United States and its allies -- not around a particular political camp or foreign policy school but around a shared understanding of how to meet a new generation of challenges. A GENERATION'S LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP Today's challenges are daunting. They include the conflict in Iraq, the resurgence of the Taliban, and global terrorist networks made even more menacing by the threat of nuclear proliferation. While Iran's leaders relentlessly pursue nuclear weapons capabilities and spout genocidal threats against Israel, the world largely stands silent, unable to agree on effective sanctions even as each day the danger grows. Genocide ravages Darfur even as the world stands frozen. In Latin America, leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez seek to reverse the spread of freedom and return to failed authoritarian policies. AIDS and potential new pandemics threaten us in an interconnected world. The economic rise of China and other countries across Asia poses a different type of challenge. It is easy to understand why Americans -- and many others around the world -- feel so much unease and uncertainty. Yet although we face fundamentally different issues today, the United States has a history of rising to meet even greater challenges. Indeed, we need not look to ancient history, but only to the courage and determination of our parents and grandparents to see a stark contrast with the confusion and infighting of Washington today. Just over 60 years ago, we were in the midst of a global war that would take the lives of tens of millions. The outcome was far from certain. General Dwight Eisenhower drafted a short note before the D-day landings at Normandy accepting full responsibility \"in case of failure.\" The invasion did not fail. Yet no sooner had we defeated fascism than we were engaged in a 50-year struggle with communism. Those whom the journalist Tom Brokaw memorialized as \"the greatest generation\" made the tough choices that allowed us to prevail in these struggles. And it was not just our Washington leaders who were decisive. In the 1940s, Americans rationed and saved, and mothers and daughters enlisted to work in factories. Together with the GIs who returned home, they built this country's prosperity and fueled a sense of optimism. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, America pursued learning and innovation to lead the world in space, technology, and productivity -- outcompeting the Soviets and driving them to an economic bankruptcy that matched their moral bankruptcy. In the aftermath of World War II and with the coming of the Cold War, members of \"the greatest generation\" united America and the free world around shared values and actions that changed history. They unified U.S. military and security efforts, creating the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. They rethought U.S. approaches to the world, building the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Peace Corps.

\u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live\u201d carried NBC to a win in the Nielsen overnight ratings on Easter Sunday.\n\nAiring from 8-10:23 p.m., \u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live\u201d drew a 1.7 rating in adults 18-49 and 9.4 million viewers. NBC\u2019s last live musical, \u201cHairspray Live,\u201d drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 9 million viewers back in December 2016. It is also up slightly over Fox\u2019s live version of the religious-themed \u201cThe Passion\u201d musical from March 2016, which drew a 1.6 and 6.6 million viewers. However, as \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d ended at 10:23 p.m., its initial numbers will be subject to adjustment later today.\n\nElsewhere on broadcast, a new episode of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d (1.6, 7.4 million) held steady with last week\u2019s Sunday episode. \u201cDeception\u201d (0.8, 4.2 million) ticked up slightly in the demo.\n\nFor CBS, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d (0.7, 8.1 million) unsurprisingly fell from the massive ratings drawn by the Stormy Daniels interview the show aired last week. Freshman drama \u201cInstinct\u201d (0.6, 6.7 million) slipped over 50% in the demo in its third week. \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d (0.8, 7.1 million) and \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d (0.5, 5.7 million) were also down versus last week.\n\nOn Fox, \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d (0.6, 1.5 million) took a hit, while \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d (0.9, 2 million) was even. \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d (0.8, 1.8 million) was down slightly, while \u201cFamily Guy\u201d (0.9, 2.1 million) was even. \u201cLast Man on Earth\u201d (0.6, 1.4 million) was down.\n\nNBC topped the night with a 1.3 rating and 7.4 million viewers. ABC was second in the demo with a 1.2 and third in total viewers with 5.8 million. CBS and Fox tied for third in the demo with a 0.7. CBS was second in viewers with 6.9 million. Fox was fourth in viewers with 1.7 million.\n\nThe live musical, which starred John Legend in the title role, averaged a 6.0 rating in Nielsen\u2019s metered market households. That is good enough to tie with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS in households as well as top ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which drew a 4.5. It is also on par with the 5.9 that NBC\u2019s last live musical, \u201cHairspray Live,\u201d drew back in 2016. \u201cHairspray Live\u201d ultimately drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and just over 9 million viewers, making it one of the lower-rated live broadcast musicals to date.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

Along with the news, FX also dropped a new website and video, featuring a group of creepy clowns revealing the title. The video is marked as \u201cWeek One,\u201d with the following seven weeks locked. You can watch the full teaser above.\n\nOnce clicking on the website, users are prompted to log in through Facebook, which it says it will use to provide exclusive \u201cAHS\u201d content ahead of the new season.\n\nThe new season also got a premiere date: Sept. 5.\n\nThe announcement was made with a special presentation in the marina behind the San Diego Convention center. A floating barge sprayed a massive wall of water into the air, with the teaser being projected onto the water. You can watch video of the presentation below.\n\nPer usual, still little is known about Season 7. What we do know, however, is that \u201cAHS\u201d veterans Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson are returning, joined by franchise newcomers Billie Lourd (who worked with Murphy on \u201cScream Queens\u201d) and \u201cBilly on the Street\u2019s\u201d Billy Eichner. Lena Dunham is also joining the new season, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the lack of information so far, \u201cAHS\u201d fans still know more about Season 7 than they did at this point ahead of the previous season, \u201cRoanoke.\u201d Murphy and FX kept that installment\u2019s theme and title under wraps all the way up until its season premiere, whetting appetites with a series of mysterious teasers.\n\nFX previously renewed \u201cAHS\u201d through Season 9. Its previous seasons have tackled different narratives, but have kept certain cast members like Peters and Paulson, and intertwined some plot points through the series.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

Bischoff has found her happy ending.\n\nThe former Bachelor contestant married her boyfriend of two years, sales manager Ricky Angel, in an ocean view ceremony Saturday at the luxury Wequassett Resort on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\nThe fertility nurse, 32, who was once engaged to former Bachelor Chris Soules (they split in 2015), walked down the aisle to \u201cMy Old Kentucky Home,\u201d a tribute to her Southern roots.\n\nBischoff wore a satin column gown that she designed with Audrey Grant Bridal and carried a bouquet of blush, white and peach blooms from The Wild Dahlia, including a single Stargazer lily, her late mother Carol\u2019s favorite flower.\n\nHer beauty look was co-designed by hairstylist Jennifer Tawa and makeup artist Amanda McCarthy Beauty, from the angel wings in the bride\u2019s chignon to the highly customized airbrushed makeup.\n\nThe couple exchanged rings by Sam Rafidia of European jewelry, as fellow Bachelor alums Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn Booth, Evan Bass and Carly Waddell looked on.\n\nBischoff met Angel, 31, in 2015 on the dating website Bumble (\u201cGirls\u2019 choice!\u201d she joked in 2016).\n\n\u201cAs soon as I met Ricky, I knew,\u201d Bischoff says. \u201cI was in a very raw emotional state after my breakup. And I could be myself with him. I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to put on a facade. I felt back to normal.

A Jedi craves not these things.\n\nBut a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ain't bad.\n\nMark Hamill, the legendary actor who portrayed Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars saga -- and whose incredible body of work spans movies, TV, theatre, video games, and voice-over -- received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today, which has been dubbed #JediDay. The accolade was dedicated in a ceremony at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, featuring Star Wars creator George Lucas and fellow Star Wars icon Harrison Ford, who delivered fun and touching tributes to their friend and collaborator.\n\n\"I'm very proud of Mark for getting this star,\" Lucas said. \"You've come a long way from that [Star Wars] casting session...to getting your star on Hollywood Boulevard.\"\n\nIn preparing for the event, Ford went back and watched their original screen test. \"He had just the right blend of youthfulness and enthusiasm,\" he said. Continuing, Ford expressed his joy for Hamill. \"He is, as he always was, a quiet, sincere, honest person...I'm happy for ya, pal.\"\n\nFinally, Hamill addressed the many fans in attendance. \"Words truly fail me. It's hard to convey my gratitude, my joy, the exhilaration of being recognized this way,\" he said. \"I haven't been this speechless since The Force Awakens.\" Hamill thanked Lucas, Ford, Disney, and his family, and recounted his journey from childhood puppet shows to working actor. But he saved a special tribute for the Star Wars faithful.\n\n\"You are with me through thick and thin, and the highs and lows, and everywhere in between,\" he said. \"From Jedi to Joker and back again, it's been a fantastic ride.

Over our years together, she's waged some pretty impressive battles. Among her many accomplishments, none is more important or rewarding-to us and to our country-than her accomplishment as a successful mother of 5 and grandmother of 16.\n\nThank you, Ann.\n\nThe other night, from opposite coasts of the country, Ann and I watched President Obama's State of the Union address. Ann figured out pretty fast what was going on. She sent me an email saying that it sounded like he was reading my CPAC speech from last year.\n\nWhat we were hearing was not just a new and improved Barack Obama; it was an entirely different Barack Obama.\n\nSaul Alinsky was out; Jeffrey Immelt was in.\n\nThe President went from \"Change you can believe in\" to \"Can you believe this change?\"\n\nHe sounded like he was going to dig up the First Lady's organic garden to put in a Bob's Big Boy.\n\nBut as the speech went on, it was clear that this was just the appearance of change: His answer for Americans out of work was more government spending and $50 billion for high speed rail.\n\nHe replaced his Chicago politician chief of staff with a fresh face from Chicago, named Daley.\n\nMake no mistake: What we are watching is not Brave New World; what we're watching is Groundhog Day!\n\nTwo years ago, this new President faced an economic crisis and an increasingly uncertain world.\n\nAn uncertain world has been made more dangerous by the lack of clear direction from a weak President. The President who touted his personal experience as giving him special insight into foreign affairs was caught unprepared when Iranian citizens rose up against oppression. His proposed policy of engagement with Iran and North Korea won him the Nobel Peace Prize. How's that worked out? Iran armed Hezbollah and Hamas and is rushing toward nuclear weapons. North Korea fired missiles, tested nukes, sunk a South Korean ship and shelled a South Korean island. And his \"reset program\" with Russia? That consisted of our President abandoning our missile defense in Poland and signing a one-sided nuclear treaty. The cause of liberty cannot endure much more of his \"they get, we give\" diplomacy!\n\nThe world - and our valiant troops - watched in confusion as the President announced that he intended to win the war in Afghanistan....as long as it didn't go much beyond August of 2011. And while the Taliban may not have an air force or sophisticated drones, it's safe to say... they do have calendars.\n\nI surely hope that at some point in the near future, the President will finally be able to construct a foreign policy, any foreign policy.\n\nHere at home, the President's response to the economic crisis was the most expensive failed social experiment in modern history.\n\nHe guaranteed that unemployment wouldn't go beyond 8%. As he watched millions and millions of Americans lose their jobs, lose their homes and lose their hope, his response was this: It could be worse.\n\nIt could be worse? This is the leader of the Free World's answer to the greatest job loss since the Great Depression? What's next? Let them eat cake?\n\nOh, excuse me. Organic cake.\n\nIt's often said that the Presidency of the United States is the toughest job in the world. Fair enough. Undoubtedly true.\n\nBut how difficult is it to take office in the middle of a raging economic crisis and understand that the economy should be your number one priority?\n\nThe President who took office on January 20th, 2009 should have had one central mission - put Americans back to work! Fight for every job! Because every job is a paycheck and paychecks fuel Americans dreams.\n\nWithout a paycheck, you can't take care of your family. Without a paycheck you can't buy school books for your kids, keep a car on the road or help an aging parent make ends meet.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern American history. And that, my friends, is one inconvenient truth that will haunt this President throughout history.\n\nToday there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan ran for President, he hung the Misery Index around Jimmy Carter's neck. Today's misery is real unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. This is the Obama Misery Index-and it's at a record high. It's going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work-it's going to take a new president.\n\nLet me make this very clear. If I decide to run for President, it won't take me two years to wake up to the job crisis threatening America. And I won't be asking Tim Geithner how the economy works-or Larry Summers how to start a business.\n\nFifteen million Americans are out of work. And millions and millions more can't find the good paying jobs they long for and deserve. You've seen the heartbreaking photos and videos of the jobs fairs around the country, where thousands show up to stand in line all day just to have a chance to compete for a few job openings that probably aren't as good as the job they held two years ago. These job fairs and unemployment lines are President Obama's Hoovervilles.\n\nMake no mistake. This is a moral tragedy-a moral tragedy of epic proportion. Unemployment is not just a statistic. Fifteen million unemployed is not just a number. Unemployment means kids can't go to college; that marriages break up under the financial strain; that young people can't find work and start their lives; and men and women in their 50s, in the prime of their lives, fear they will never find a job again. Liberals should be ashamed that they and their policies have failed these good and decent Americans!\n\nThe President is trying to show that he finally gets it-that he really isn't a liberal after all. But his idea of conservative economic policy is to invite some corporate CEO's to the White House for an evening of table-talk.\n\nI'm sorry Mr. President, but that's not a policy, it's a dinner party.\n\nWe've seen the failure of liberal answers before. Liberal welfare policies condemned generations to dependency and poverty. Liberal education policies fail our children today, because they put pensions and privilege for union bosses above the reading scores of our kids. Liberal social policies have failed to protect the unborn. And now, the hollow promises of liberal economic policies have failed to provide millions of Americans with the dignity of work.\n\nUnder the pressure of a crisis, people turn to what they really believe. With our economy in crisis, the President and his fellow liberals turned to Europe for their answers. Like the Europeans, they grew the government, they racked up bigger deficits, they took over healthcare, they pushed cap and trade, they stalled production of our oil and gas and coal, they fought to impose unions on America's workers, and they created over a hundred new agencies and commissions and hundreds of thousands of pages of new regulations. Theirs is a European-style solution to an American problem. It does not work there and it will never work here!\n\nThe right answer is not to believe in European solutions. The right answer is to believe in America-to believe in free enterprise, capitalism, limited government, federalism-and to believe in the constitution, as it was written and intended by the founders.\n\nMy father never graduated from college. He apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter, and he was darn good at it. He learned how to put a handful of nails in his mouth and spit them out, point forward. On his honeymoon, he and Mom drove across the country. Dad sold aluminum paint along the way, to pay for gas and hotels.\n\nDad always believed in America; and in that America, a lath and plaster man could work his way up to running a little car company called American Motors and end up Governor of a state where he had once sold aluminum paint.\n\nFor my Dad, America was the land of opportunity, where free enterprise, small business and entrepreneurs were encouraged and respected. The spirit of enterprise propelled America's economy and our standard of living past every other nation on earth.\n\nI refuse to believe that America is just another place on the map with a flag. I believe that America is an exceptional nation, of freedom and opportunity and hope. The America I believe in has goodness and a greatness that creates a unique American genius. That genius has blessed the world, led the world and yes, even saved the world from unimaginable darkness.\n\nWe didn't originate the concept of liberty but our Founding Fathers redefined it and shared it with the world. From the brilliant sands of Omaha beach to the dark valleys of the Hindu Kush, we have fought with an unmatched courage and determination, not to conquer territory, but to give others the chance to experience the liberty that is humanity's destiny.\n\nGiven all that America has done to lift others from poverty, given the millions of afflicted we have helped to heal and comfort, and given the hundreds of thousands of lives of America's sons and daughters that have been, and are today, sacrificed to defend freedom, I will not apologize for America!\n\nI don't apologize for America because I believe in America!\n\nWe believe in freedom, in opportunity. We believe in free enterprise and capitalism. We believe in the American dream. And we believe that the principles that made America the leader of the world today are the very principles that will keep America the leader of the world tomorrow.\n\nThese last two years have not been the best of times. But while we've lost a couple of years, we have not lost our way.\n\nThis is fundamentally what conservatism is all about. We sing for God to bless America. He already has, he does now and thanks to the greatness of the American people and the principles that guide us, he will do so for generations to come.\n\nBelieve in America. Freedom depends on it.\n\nThank you.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

Statewide 'Opinion Counts' Survey Results Survey conducted 7\/24\/08 - 7\/25\/08 Remember to click here and add your email address to our new mailing list and receive survey results in your mailbox every month. We will not share your email address with anyone. Survey Methodology This survey was fielded July 24 -25, 2008 as part of the Hays Research Group Statewide Opinion Counts Survey. 404 completed respondents were interviewed The margin of error for the data collected is +\/- 4.86 % for a 404 response survey for the data analyzed in its entirety with a 95% confidence level; meaning that we can be 95% sure that if every resident of the State with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections was actually surveyed, the results would vary by no more than 4.86% in either direction. The survey sample used was a computer generated random list derived from a database of all households within the State of Alaska with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections. The sample frame was designed to accurately reflect the actual population percentages. Respondents were screened to confirm they were over 18 and each household was attempted at least four times over a period of several days to account for non-response bias. Data was analyzed utilizing SPSS Quancept Software. Interviews were conducted by trained staff with on-site supervision utilizing state of the art computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Random interviews were monitored to assure quality control measures were followed. Dialing results were analyzed daily to assure statistically accurate distribution of call disposition in order to account for \u201cnon-response\u201d variables.

( Here's a handy chart of when the procedure has been used .)Under reconciliation, Democrats would need a simple majority in the Senate to pass legislation, as opposed to the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster.\"They should stop crying about reconciliation as if it's never been done before,\" Reid said.Following Senate Democrats' weekly luncheon, Reid said \"nothing is off the table\" but that \"realistically, they should stop crying about this. It's been done 21 times before.\"\"The question is: Is reconciliation the only way we can do health-care reform?\" he said. \"The answer to that is no.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY), Ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a joint statement today after the U.S. State Department confirmed that Feisal Abdul Rauf, imam of the proposed Ground Zero Mosque in New York City, will travel to the Middle East through a taxpayer-funded program of the International Information Programs Bureau at the State Department. Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King:\n\n\n\nIt is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East.\n\n\n\nAbdul Rauf has cast blame for 9\/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\n\n\nThis radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it.\n\n\n\nThe State Departments selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administrations policy and funding priorities.\n\n\n\nBackground: In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S. He called the attacks a reaction against the U.S. Government politically I wouldn't say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world. In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA.\n\n\n\nNote: On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf a distinguished Muslim cleric and noted that the State Department send[s] people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society.\n\n\n\n######","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324\/http:\/\/republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov:80\/press_display.asp?id=1583","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2757\/4093404710_6aafcfceab_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4014\/4477466276_5b11ff5933_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2462\/4093482522_5ce2eee573_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2719\/4093812806_01cdb20964_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2449\/4092716587_d983ded2c3_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/cdn.printfriendly.com\/pf-icon-small.gif","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov\/img\/btnShare.gif","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2754\/4477474820_464fbb2ee0_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2790\/4093102561_e8eccd6752_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2438\/4093010783_a11ce3045b_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2763\/4476774905_7f7982ec98_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2647\/4093047995_2e369b108d_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2655\/4093048815_216769b8b1_s.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100821215324im_\/http:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4049\/4585055608_5f5a0bba17_s.jpg"],"top_img":"","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"","headline":"U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs","meta_data":{},"movies":[],"publish_date":null,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":[1],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"I came to Washington to fight for a smaller government and get spending under control, not shut the government down. In fact, I have repeatedly voted to fund the government in the last few days.\n\nThe shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability.\n\nUnfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge.\n\nI want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is.\n\nShutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding \u2014 it doesn't even touch mandatory funding.\n\nSince its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare.\n\nObamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.\n\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter Columnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.

For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row. We need to continue to take steps forward, shedding off our \"excessive funding weight\" one pound at a time. That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year.\n\nWe need to get the government running again and end this shutdown so that our communities can get back on their feet.\n\nRep.

Zach Boyden-Holmes, Des Moines Register\n\nChris Soules, the reality television celebrity from Iowa, is set to avoid trial in connection with a deadly crash last year in northeast Iowa after pleading guilty to a reduced charge Tuesday.\n\nIn conjunction with the plea, defense lawyers asserted that the farm tractor Soules' struck while driving his pickup truck, fatally injuring 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora, was improperly lit. Lawyers also revealed new information about injuries Soules sustained.\n\nThe nighttime collision in April 2017 set off over 18 months of high-profile court proceedings, with tabloid media documenting Soules' appearances at a courthouse in Independence, a television reporter charged with a crime for recording video inside a courtroom, and arguments by Soules' lawyers that an Iowa law was unconstitutional.\n\nSoules, the star of the 19th season of ABC's \"The Bachelor,\" was originally charged with a felony for leaving the scene of a deadly accident.\n\n\u25ba UPDATE: Judge denies 'Bachelor' star Chris Soules' request to delay sentencing in fatal 2017 crash\n\n\u25ba PREVIOUSLY: Chris Soules' real life in rural Iowa\n\nHe pleaded guilty Tuesday of leaving the scene of a personal injury accident, which is an aggravated misdemeanor. Rather than a sentence of up to five years in prison, Soules now faces up to two years at his sentencing Jan. 8. He also has the ability to withdraw his guilty plea if a judge does not accept the plea agreement he struck with prosecutors.\n\nIn an affidavit filed Tuesday, Soules' attorney Brandon Brown said that neither Soules nor an independent witness to the crash saw any lights on Mosher's tractor before the collision. By law, the tractor would have been required to display flashing amber lights, the affidavit states.\n\nSoules, 36, was later diagnosed with a concussion resulting from the crash, Brown said. Even though his airbag deployed, it \"did not prevent Mr. Soules from hitting his head on the windshield so hard that it shattered.\"\n\nIn his signed plea, Soules acknowledged he failed to provide his vehicle's registration number to 911 dispatch or law enforcement, as required by Iowa law.\n\nAt his sentencing, Soules will be free to request a deferred judgment or suspended sentence, which would let him avoid prison time and possibly remove the charge from his record.\n\nJudge Andrea Dryer ordered a routine pre-sentence investigation report to be completed ahead of Soules' sentencing.\n\nSoules appeared on \"The Bachelor\" in 2015, where his roots as a farmer in rural Arlington, Iowa, played a prominent role and earned him the nickname, \"Prince Farming.\"\n\nMosher, who was on a tractor without an enclosed cab, was driving as slow as 6 miles per hour, Brown's affidavit states. Soules was driving his truck below the posted 55 mph speed limit, and Brown said experts concluded Soules acted reasonably given the circumstances.\n\n\"Mr. Soules found himself in an unavoidable accident,\" Brown's affidavit states.\n\nSoules called 911 and administered CPR until the compressions caused blood to come from Mosher's mouth. He remained on scene until paramedics arrived and directed them to Mosher, then left several minutes later. Mosher was taken to a local hospital and later died.\n\nAfter the crash, four other individuals arrived at the scene \"nearly immediately,\" according to court documents.\n\n\"No one, even the individuals who knelt in close proximity to Mr. Soules while he administered CPR, smelled any alcohol or had any belief Mr. Soules had been drinking,\" Brown's affidavit states.\n\nSoules' attorneys argued throughout the legal process that a trial would irreparably damage his reputation as a public figure. They also said the law Soules was accused of breaking was invalid because it compromised the constitutional rights of anybody charged under it. Earlier this year they unsuccessfully appealed for the Iowa Supreme Court to take up the case before it went to trial. Last month they said publicly that they were in the process of negotiating a plea.\n\nNeither Soules' attorneys nor Buchanan County Attorney Shawn Harden commented Tuesday. Mosher's family has declined to speak with reporters since the crash.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com\/story\/news\/crime-and-courts\/2018\/11\/13\/abc-bachelor-chris-soules-pleads-guilty-leaving-scene-fatal-crash-killed-kenny-mosher-arlington-iowa\/1975979002\/","images":["https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-play-alt-white.svg","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/8b5dca4c54b24584d95cf15efba87939124804da\/c=0-204-5753-3454\/local\/-\/media\/2017\/11\/27\/IAGroup\/DesMoines\/636473825051305049-112717-Chris-Soules-RWHITE-4920.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-instagram_24.png","https:\/\/media.gannett-cdn.com\/28911775001\/28911775001_5849576645001_5849579232001-vs.jpg?pubId=28911775001"],"top_img":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/8b5dca4c54b24584d95cf15efba87939124804da\/c=0-204-5753-3454\/local\/-\/media\/2017\/11\/27\/IAGroup\/DesMoines\/636473825051305049-112717-Chris-Soules-RWHITE-4920.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","keywords":[],"authors":["Stephen Gruber-Miller"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com\/story\/news\/crime-and-courts\/2018\/11\/13\/abc-bachelor-chris-soules-pleads-guilty-leaving-scene-fatal-crash-killed-kenny-mosher-arlington-iowa\/1975979002\/","headline":"Iowa 'Bachelor' Chris Soules pleads guilty to leaving the scene of an accident","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1","HandheldFriendly":"True","MobileOptimized":320,"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=524153305, app-argument=https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com\/story\/news\/crime-and-courts\/2018\/11\/13\/abc-bachelor-chris-soules-pleads-guilty-leaving-scene-fatal-crash-killed-kenny-mosher-arlington-iowa\/1975979002\/news\/crime-and-courts","theme-color":"#ffffff","og":{"title":"Iowa 'Bachelor' Chris Soules pleads guilty to leaving the scene of an accident","description":"Soules was charged in connection to a fatal 2017 crash that killed 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora.","site_name":"The Des Moines Register","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/8b5dca4c54b24584d95cf15efba87939124804da\/c=0-204-5753-3454\/local\/-\/media\/2017\/11\/27\/IAGroup\/DesMoines\/636473825051305049-112717-Chris-Soules-RWHITE-4920.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","width":1200,"height":675}},"description":"Soules was charged in connection to a fatal 2017 crash that killed 66-year-old Kenny Mosher of Aurora.","twitter":{"site":"@DMRegister","creator":"@DMRegister","card":"summary_large_image"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":1542063600.0,"source":"https:\/\/www.desmoinesregister.com","summary":"","label":[1],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"Meghan Markle loves her daring gold talon hook earrings from the luxury British jeweler Shaun Leane \u2014 and she\u2019s in fashionable company: models Cara Delevingne, Kendall Jenner and Anja Rubik are also fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very flattered that Meghan wears our work,\u201d Leane tells PEOPLE from his atelier and showroom in London\u2019s Mayfair.\n\nLeane says Meghan, who has made his earrings one of her go-to jewelry pieces in recent months, \u201cis the woman I have in my mind when I design.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe dresses very elegantly, very chic, with very clean lines but with a really nice strong silhouette,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s very confidant.\u201d\n\nThe royal, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry, owns three pieces from the avant-garde jeweler: the Yellow Gold Vermeil Diamond Tusk Bangle ($1281), Yellow Gold Vermeil Serpents Trace Slim Bracelet ($708) and the popular Yellow Gold Vermeil Talon Earrings ($290), all of which were purchased as a gift by Meghan\u2019s close friend Markus Anderson.\n\nMeghan first wore the pieces to the Queen\u2019s 92nd birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall on April, just days after Anderson purchased them.\n\nShe has since worn them on multiple other occasions \u2014 to Charlie van Straubenzee\u2019s wedding in August, at a performance of Hamilton, also in August, and most recently on her royal tour Down Under with Harry.\n\nThe earrings \u2014 which also come in silver, rose gold vermeil and silver black rhodium \u2014 are one of Leane\u2019s signatures, inspired by the jeweler\u2019s 20-year working relationship with the late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen and their shared love of tribal jewelry.\n\n\u201cThe earrings are quite intriguing when they are worn. They make you want to look twice, and I love that reaction,\u201d says Leane.\n\n\u201cThey are elegant and refined,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut there\u2019s an edge.\u201d\n\nLeane has accessorized celebrities such as Adele, Cameron Diaz, Kate Moss and Uma Thurman in his 35-year career. But nothing compares to the \u201cMeghan Markle effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dressed a lot of people, but the effect of dressing someone like Meghan is unbelievable \u2014 it\u2019s amazing and it\u2019s a real honor,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile the talon earrings are consistently a bestseller for his brand, after Meghan was photographed in them they sold six-months worth of stock in just four weeks, Leane says. \u201cWith Meghan, it\u2019s on another level. It opens you up to a whole new demographic because she is on the global stage.\u201d\n\nLeane says he doesn\u2019t see her sartorial power diminishing anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI think she considers what she wears for each event very well,\u201d he says, \u201cand she really does have a great eye.\u201d\n\nFor Black Friday, Leane\u2019s eponymous retailer is offering 20 percent off all purchases

Grande, look away!\n\nAfter Millie Bobby Brown shared a photo of herself sharing a kiss with boyfriend Jacob Sartorius on the beach, the 24-year-old pop star couldn\u2019t resist cracking a joke about how things were different when she was the Stranger Things actress\u2019 age.\n\nCommenting on the sweet post \u2014 which Brown, 14, captioned \u201cMoonlight with him\u201d \u2014 Grande wrote, \u201cI wasn\u2019t even allowed to leave my house til i was 20.\n\nMilly Bobby Brown\/Instagram\n\nSartorius, 15, also shared the same photo on his Instagram feed, using the same caption \u2014 with just one minor tweak.\n\n\u201cMoonlight with her,\u201d he wrote alongside the image.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nWhile the actress has yet to respond to Grande\u2019s joking comment, the pair have a history of giving each other some friendly feedback.\n\nAhead of the Golden Globes this year, Brown texted back and forth with the \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d singer, as the pair discussed the dress the actress planned to wear that evening.\n\nSharing a photo of their conversation on social media, Brown wrote, \u201clove her so much.\u201d\n\nGrande has also made headlines recently over her budding relationship with Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson.\n\nEarlier this week, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Grande and Davidson \u2014 who joined the singer backstage at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday, May 20 \u2014 recently began a romantic relationship but that it was still \u201cvery casual.\n\nThe Stranger Things actress and Sartorius first sparked dating rumors in October, when she posted a photo of him to her Instagram Story. After months of flirting between the two on social media, Brown posted a picture of herself cuddling a giant teddy bear with the caption, \u201cThanks for the bear\u201d in January. Sartorius commented on the picture, \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, the pair exchanged sweet messages, and a week later, Sartorius wished Brown a happy birthday with a post declaring his love for \u201cthis beautiful girl.\u201d","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n\nDavid Matthews, the father-in-law of Duchess Kate's sister Pippa Middleton, was arrested by French police earlier this week and charged with the rape of a minor in the late 1990s, the Agence France Press wire service and British newspaper The Telegraph reported Friday.\n\nAccording to those two outlets, Matthews, 74, was taken into custody Tuesday at Paris' Orly Airport and questioned by officers from the Protection of Minors Brigade.\n\nA Parisian judicial official confirmed his arrest to The Telegraph.\n\nOn Thursday, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation and a magistrate charged Matthews with raping a female minor.\n\nThe official who spoke to The Telegraph said Matthews' alleged crimes were committed in 1998 and 1999. The newspaper reported that he \"strenuously denied the allegations.\"\n\n\u201cThe investigations will now continue as a judicial investigation and will be led by an investigating judge,\" the official told The Telegraph, adding that he has been released from custody and has not been ordered to remain in France.\n\nWho is David Matthews?\n\nThe son of a coal miner, Matthews worked his way up from mechanic to racecar driver. After a horrific crash at Britain's Silverstone track in 1973, he retired and poured his efforts into his car dealership, which he sold in 1991 in favor of property development.\n\nHe then bought and rehabbed the Eden Roc hotel on the Carribean island of St. Barths, eventually building it into a glitzy, celeb-friendly haunt. However, the resort suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.\n\nHe and his second wife, the Zimbabwe-born Jane Parker (whom he married in the 1970s), divide their time between their two British estates: Caunton Manor, a 30-acre spread in Nottinghamshire, and Glen Affric, a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland.\n\nTheir eldest son James, 42, followed David into the race car business before moving into securities trading. He married Middleton, 34, in a lavish May 2017 ceremony attended by her older sister, the Duchess Kate of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, his brother Prince Harry and his future fianc\u00e9e, American actress Meghan Markle, who attended the reception. Will and Kate's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, served as a page boy and flower girl in the ceremony.\n\nDue to the hour at which the story broke, Kensington Palace, which represents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nThe Matthews' middle son, Michael, a derivatives trader, died at age 22 while descending Mt. Everest in 1999, after becoming the youngest Briton to summit the world's highest peak. The Matthews family created an education foundation in his memory.\n\nYoungest son Spencer, 28, is a reality TV star whose credits include Made in Chelsea, The Bachelor and I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out of Here!\n\nMatthews also has a daughter, Nina, from his first marriage to fellow racecar driver Anita Taylor.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2018\/03\/30\/pippa-middletons-father-law-david-matthews-arrested-charge-raping-minor-1990-s\/474647002\/","images":["https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-play-alt-white.svg","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/54fd27fbca41e7c5199637970607e0e15d1cd62f\/c=0-0-2061-1165\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/appservices\/universal-web\/universal\/icons\/icon-instagram_24.png","http:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/53616e9bf9bdd8c1be7b755f02ccfdb1ab42f52b\/c=0-0-2061-1165&r=1280x720\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg"],"top_img":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/54fd27fbca41e7c5199637970607e0e15d1cd62f\/c=0-0-2061-1165\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","keywords":[],"authors":["Jayme Deerwester"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2018\/03\/30\/pippa-middletons-father-law-david-matthews-arrested-charge-raping-minor-1990-s\/474647002\/","headline":"Pippa Middleton's father-in-law David Matthews arrested on charge of raping minor in 1990s","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width,initial-scale=1","HandheldFriendly":"True","MobileOptimized":320,"apple-itunes-app":"app-id=504631398, app-argument=https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2018\/03\/30\/pippa-middletons-father-law-david-matthews-arrested-charge-raping-minor-1990-s\/474647002\/life\/people","theme-color":"#ffffff","og":{"type":"article","title":"Pippa Middleton's father-in-law David Matthews arrested on charge of raping minor in 1990s","description":"David Matthews, whose son James is married to Duchess Kate's sister, was arrested Tuesday in Paris and charged with raping a minor in the 1990s.","site_name":"USA TODAY","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/www.gannett-cdn.com\/-mm-\/54fd27fbca41e7c5199637970607e0e15d1cd62f\/c=0-0-2061-1165\/local\/-\/media\/2018\/03\/30\/USATODAY\/USATODAY\/636580263451239229-AFP-AFP-13G49V.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200","width":1200,"height":675}},"article":{"content_tier":"free","opinion":"false"},"fb":{"pages":13652355666},"description":"David Matthews, whose son James is married to Duchess Kate's sister, was arrested Tuesday in Paris and charged with raping a minor in the 1990s.","twitter":{"site":"@usatoday","creator":"@usatoday","card":"summary_large_image"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":1522360800.0,"source":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com","summary":"","label":[1],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"Somebody grab the tissues!\n\nEleven years after the death of Steve Irwin, his legacy lives on through his children, Bindi, 19, and Robert, 14. During Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, a moving clip aired for the Irwin family\u2019s new Animal Planet series, which featured Steve reflecting on his passion for wildlife conservation and his family\u2019s involvement.\n\nHis daughter Bindi shared the truly moving video of her late father to Twitter.\n\n\u201cMy first time watching this footage was only a few days ago,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to describe the amount of emotion in my heart once the video ended. My dad. My superhero. I promise to do my best to make you proud and ensure your legacy lives on forever.\u201d\n\nThe video features a visibly emotional Steve talking about his children, saying, \u201cIs there anything in this world that would want to make me give away what I\u2019m doing now? Yes, there is. When my children can take the football that I call wildlife conservation and run it up. When they\u2019re ready to run up our mission, I\u2019ll gladly step aside, and I guarantee you it will be the proudest moment of my life.\u201d\n\nChoking back tears, Steve continued, \u201cThen and only then will I know that I have achieved my ultimate goal, to be able to stand aside and let them run up my mission.\u201d\n\nFellow Aussie, Russell Crowe, also tweeted the footage, writing, \u201cAh, talk about a Super Bowl day moment\u2026 what a top bloke\u2026 tough as nails, heart on his sleeve, never a wasted breath, full of love and man could he make me laugh.\u201d\n\nBindi, who was only eight years old when her father died, and her younger brother, Robert, have indeed continued their father\u2019s work in wildlife conservation. They work with all kinds of animals at the Australia Zoo alongside their mother, Terri Irwin.\n\nBindi previously opened up on the Today show about how she honors the Crocodile Hunter star's memory, saying, \u201cWe do want to carry on in dad\u2019s footsteps, and make sure everything he worked so hard for continues on.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s series will premiere on the Animal Planet in the fall 2018. Steve\u2019s show, The Crocodile Hunter, aired on the Animal Planet from 1996 to 2007.\n\nFor more from the Irwins, watch the clip below!\n\nRELATED

Mom OG star Ryan Edwards\u2018 wife Mackenzie Standifer Edwards celebrated Halloween with a very special little pumpkin by her side!\n\nIn celebration of the spooky holiday on Wednesday, Mackenzie shared a smiling photo of herself standing beside 10-year-old stepson Bentley \u2014 dressed up in a No. 24 football uniform, which he also wore last year \u2014 and a stroller carrying her little one, whose face is covered by a pumpkin emoji.\n\nShe also gave an update on her husband, who checked into rehab earlier this month, according to Us Weekly.\n\nWhen an Instagram user asked if Ryan was still in rehab, Mackenzie said, \u201cHe is doing SO good. Proud of him!\n\nMackenzie gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child \u2014 son Jagger Ryan Edwards \u2014 on Oct. 9, PEOPLE confirms. He weighed 7 lbs. and 1 oz., according to Radar Online.\n\nJagger is Mackenzie\u2019s second child. She also has son Hudson, 4, from a previous relationship.\n\nThe reality TV pair secretly tied the knot before Ryan, who shares Bentley with Teen Mom OG\u2018s Maci Bookout, headed to rehab back in May 2017, and they exchanged vows at a church ceremony in November 2017.\n\nIn an April episode of Teen Mom OG, Mackenzie confirmed her pregnancy when she showed a positive test to producer Jeni, who quickly hugged and congratulated her.\n\nWhen asked if her husband was happy, Mackenzie said, \u201c[He] was so excited, he couldn\u2019t contain himself.\u201d\n\nThroughout her pregnancy, Mackenzie shared shots of her growing baby bump to Instagram.\n\nIn July, Mackenzie shared a sweet snap in which she sat under a blanket and rested her hand on top of her bump as Ryan\u2019s hand touched the lower part of her stomach.\n\n\u201cHappiness is H\u2022O\u2022M\u2022E\u2022M\u2022A\u2022D\u2022E,\u201d she captioned the photo.\n\nTeen Mom OG airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on

But to celebrate the year's most romantic day, a Virgin Atlantic flight went not one but 100 extra miles.A Virgin Atlantic flight took off from London's Gatwick Airport and flew to UK's southwest coast to draw a heart-shaped flight course on the occasion of Valentine's Day. The Airbus A330 plane took off from London at 11.30am and spent about two hours creating a Valentine-appropriate heart-shaped flight path measuring about 100 miles in length.The unique flight path was spotted by air traffic monitoring portal \"Flight radar 24\" which shared a screenshot of the flight's route.However, some people Twitter were not impressed with Virgin Atlantic's Valentine's Day gimmick and called out the airline for wasting aviation fuel and causing possible delays. Responding to people's concerns, the airline clarified that the flight was for training purposes.\"This was a required training flight that happened to take place on Valentines Day, so we altered the flight path slightly to make a heart shape,\" Virgin Atlantic said in tweets.The airline later shared an animation of the flight drawing the heart 30,000 feet in the sky.Click for more trending

O\u2019Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That\u2019s when the \u201ctolerant\u201d liberals got violent.\n\nOne of the men grabbed O\u2019Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.\n\nO\u2019Reilly was taken to St. Vincent\u2019s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.\n\nThe family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O\u2019Reilly \u201cgot what he deserved\u201d for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.\n\nLiberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don\u2019t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be \u201ctortured,\u201d but it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he\u2019s done.\n\nLiberalism is truly a mental disorder.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933\/http:\/\/usleader.net:80\/index.php\/2017\/05\/11\/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals\/","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Clipboard01-2.jpg"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/index.php\/2017\/05\/11\/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals\/","headline":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","description":"Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was","robots":"noodp","og":{"locale":"en_US","type":"article","title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","description":"Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/index.php\/2017\/05\/11\/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals\/","site_name":"US Leader","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg","width":678,"height":381}},"article":{"tag":"Critical","section":"POLITICS","published_time":"2017-05-11T15:58:29+00:00"},"twitter":{"card":"summary","description":"Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was","title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516012933im_\/http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1.jpg"},"generator":"WordPress 4.7.4","ca_title":"BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals","ca_image":"http:\/\/usleader.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/amb-1-150x150.jpg"},"movies":[],"publish_date":1494453600.0,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":[0],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"Illegal aliens residing in the state of California in defiance of federal immigration laws would now be able to serve on all state and local boards and commissions under a proposal introduced before the California state Senate. Now the state of California has appointed its first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee.\n\nThe committee\u2019s formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful \u2014 the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or \u201cCal-SOAP,\u201d for short \u2014 but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to college\n\nMateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice.\n\nMateo said via Fox News \u2013 \u201cWhile undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 174 made Mateo\u2019s appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities,\u201d Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bill\u2019s author said in a statement. \u201cUndocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we can\u2019t make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De Le\u00f3n\u2019s office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateo\u2019s committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.\n\nMateo took to Twitter to celebrate tweeting \u2013 In #lawschool I often wondered if I was fit to b in #lawjournal, #mootcourt bc not many ppl w\/ my same background did. I always went for it bc even if I felt inadequate I thought I could add something of value. I hope to do the same w\/ @StudentAidCommission. #undocumentedunafraid.Thank you Sen. @ kdeleon for appointing me to the CalSOAP Advisory Committee. I look forward to working w\/ the rest of the committee & the Student Aid Commission in such important task \u2013 increase the accessibility of postsecondary education opportunities for low-income students. Interestingly enough, however, Moteo seems to be confused about which country she prefers and which country has her loyalty. In a 2016 Facebook post that appears in celebration of her graduation from Santa Clara University School of Law, Mateo proclaims publicly in Spanish \u2013\n\n\u201cEverything is dedicated to Oaxaca, Mexico!! to that land that I miss so much.\u201d\n\nIf she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government.\n\nIt is important to note that while Mateo is the first \u201cunprotected\u201d illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws.\n\nMany were also quick to point out Mateo\u2019s hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law. One Twitter user asked Mateo some very pointed and direct questions \u2013 \u201cAs someone who studies and practices the law, how can you at the same time flout the very principles of justice that law and order is based on?!?! You are a fraud and should answer for breaking the laws of this land.\u201d\n\nCiting EdSource data, de Leon\u2019s office said an estimated 72,300 undocumented students are enrolled in California\u2019s public colleges and universities. (Of those, about 60,000 attend community colleges, 8,300 are in the California State University system and 4,000 are on University of California campuses.) Perhaps ICE should hit here for their next raid?","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/it-begins-california-appoints-first-illegal-alien-to-state-office-trump-has-better-plan\/","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132im_\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Untitled-4.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132im_\/http:\/\/media.breitbart.com\/media\/2018\/03\/Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-6.52.21-AM.png"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132im_\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Untitled-4.png","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/it-begins-california-appoints-first-illegal-alien-to-state-office-trump-has-better-plan\/","headline":"IT BEGINS: California Appoints FIRST Illegal Alien to State Office \u2013 Trump Has Better Plan","meta_data":{"fb":{"pages":817541391723453},"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0","format-detection":"telephone=no","generator":"WordPress 4.9.5","og":{"type":"article","title":"IT BEGINS: California Appoints FIRST Illegal Alien to State Office \u2013 Trump Has Better Plan","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/it-begins-california-appoints-first-illegal-alien-to-state-office-trump-has-better-plan\/","description":"Illegal aliens residing in the state of California in defiance of federal immigration laws would now be able to serve on all state and local boards and commissions under a proposal introduced befor\u2026","site_name":"The Breaking Dawn","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132im_\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Untitled-4.png","width":571,"height":300},"locale":"en_US"},"article":{"published_time":"2018-05-10T10:27:59+00:00","modified_time":"2018-05-10T10:27:59+00:00"},"twitter":{"text":{"title":"IT BEGINS: California Appoints FIRST Illegal Alien to State Office \u2013 Trump Has Better Plan"},"image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180514221132im_\/https:\/\/www.thebreakingdawn.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Untitled-4.png?w=640","card":"summary_large_image"}},"movies":[],"publish_date":1525948079.0,"source":"https:\/\/web.archive.org","summary":"","label":[0],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"Maxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant.

We\u2019re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,\u201d Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n\u201cI love the Sixties,\u201d said Trump, continuing, \u201cI was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.\u201d In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. \u201cYou have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We\u2019re not going to give it to them, folks. They\u2019re going to have to earn their citizenship.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won\u2019t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing \u201cman-portable\u201d tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we\u2019re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.\u201d\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option \u201cextremely\u201d liberally. \u201cMy feeling is we have these weapons and we\u2019ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there\u2019s absolutely no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be using them.\u201d\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. \u201cThis guy\u2019s the president of the United States and he\u2019s bowing to the Chinese. They\u2019re laughing in our faces, okay?

The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless\u201d or \u201cconscientious\u201d electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton\u2019s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation\u2019s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214\/http:\/\/usasnich.com:80\/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president\/","images":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214im_\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/919-696x364-800x509.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214im_\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/919-696x364.jpg"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214im_\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/919-696x364.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161213021214\/http:\/\/usasnich.com\/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president\/","headline":"BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1","robots":"noindex,follow","og":{"locale":"en_US","type":"article","title":"BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT","description":"BREAKING!

The biggest sign it's over is the fact that Eva and Ryan don't even bother to argue anymore. The only thing they do agree on is the fact that none of their needs are being met!\" says the source.\n\n\n\nAccording to a source, Ryan and Eva's relationship broke up after he chose to celebrate Mother's Day with his mom, Donna, rather than Eva. Their relationship has reportedly been toxic behind closed doors for quite a long time now.\n\n\n\nRyan was devastated when Eva refused to accompany him to the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, despite his Best Actor nods for \"La La Land\", according to sources.\n\n\n\nThe source claims, \"Everyone's kind of gotten used to Eva shunning the limelight, but no one ever thought for a moment she'd skip the Oscars - especially when Ryan was nominated for a once-in-a-lifetime accolade. It didn't make sense. When they first got together, they were inseparable and were often seen out on dates holding hands. Now that just doesn't happen.\"\n\n\n\nEva reportedly refused to accompany Ryan on the annual award shows as she was jealous with his co-star Emma Stone. \"Emma and Ryan have THE hottest chemistry in Hollywood right now. Eva seems to feel totally intimidated by Emma, even though neither Emma nor Ryan have given her any reason to worry,\" shares the source.\n\n\n\n\"Since Eva bowed out of the public eye, she's like a paranoid hermit, and it's driven a huge wedge between them,\" the source tells Radar Online, \"She'll go weeks without speaking to any other adult except Ryan. It makes for a pretty intense situation. Eva won't go out, and she avoids his family.

She will either let her successor Prince Charles take over or Prince Williams will be given the crown.\n\nThere were reports suggesting that Prince of Wales is pursuing the Queen to step down to give him the charge. There were also speculations that her highness wants Prince William and Kate Middleton to take over the throne. Amidst these speculations, a tabloid claims that the Queen is dying and she has decided to let the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take over.\n\nThe report published by Star suggests that William and Kate's reign will begin after baby number 3 while Charles and Camilla will be banished forever. \"In a startling twist, the Duke and Duchess will become the next king and queen, and with Prince Charles cast aside, they're ready to modernise the monarchy,\" the outlet writes.\n\nA palace insider told the magazine that the coronation will happen soon after Kate Middleton's delivery. \"The coronation will happen after Kate has [their third] baby. Shunting Charles aside is an unprecedented break from tradition, but it's the right time to shake things up. Will and Kate are a welcome breath of fresh air, and they're going to do things their own way!\" the source says.\n\nWhile the tabloid over and over repeats that Prince Charles is banished and Queen's decision to choose William and Kate over the immediate successor, the report mentions nothing about \"how\" the couple will rule the throne \u2013 wasn't that the headline in the first place, Star?\n\nThe fluff piece has been called out by Gossip Cop and they confirm that their report is a false story. The Queen has made no such decision and Charles hasn't been \"banished forever from the throne,\" as the report suggests.\n\n\"Our sources at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace that the claims in this latest version are made up,\" Gossip Cop writes.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet \u2014 Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.\n\nFor some celebrities, this would not be a big deal \u2014 some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as \u201csources\u201d and \u201cinsiders\u201d dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.\n\nAfter all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.\n\nSo the decision to keep Kylie\u2019s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.\n\nThe non-confirmation of the news \u2014 reported by the tabloids in September and described as a \u201chappy\u201d surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott \u2014 has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family\u2019s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie\u2019s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.\n\nMeanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie\u2019s first public appearance since the fall, although she\u2019s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her.

Check out this conversation between the two that has fans buzzing!\n\nWe always knew Andy Cohen, 49, was great friends with the Kardashian family. However, we didn\u2019t know they were so close that Khloe Kardashian, 33, would name her first child after the Bravo host! Well, it\u2019s a joke, but a clever joke at that, that had fans in a tizzy during a Twitter exchange on April 8. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet baby Andy! (That\u2019s the name right?!),\u201d Andy tweeted at Khloe while discussing The Real Housewives of Atlanta. \u201cI mean, I was going to surprise you but you guessed her name,\u201d Khloe replied, clearly joking that she\u2019s already planned to name her baby after Andy. While we wish this was a legitimate reveal, Khloe continues to keep us guessing. Check out their playful conversation below!\n\nThe conversation started when Khloe tweeted that part 1 of the RHOA reunion was \u201cjust too good,\u201d before thanking Andy for yet another juicy broadcast. The Bravo host then told Khloe she has \u201can OPEN invite\u201d to the reunion [which is three parts]. Khloe said she would totally be there, however, the \u201conly thing\u201d holding her back is that she\u2019s \u201cabout to give birth.\u201d \u2014 Which leads up to the most recent report involving her pregnancy.\n\nKhloe is reportedly in labor, according to TMZ on April 9. While we do know that the Good American designer is in Cleveland, patiently waiting for the arrival of her daughter with boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, 27, nothing else has been confirmed involving the birth. Adding to the speculation, Kylie Jenner\u2018s, OB\/GYN, Dr. Thais Aliabadi, posted a photo of herself traveling for work over the weekend. The interesting timing of her flight had fans buzzing that she was traveling to Cleveland to assist with Khloe\u2019s delivery; Since the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is due to give birth any day now.\n\nKhloe and Tristan are expecting their first child together, a baby girl, which they announced on December 20, 2017. Khloe\u2019s baby shower took place on March 10 in CA, where her family and friends, including Kim Zolciak-Biermann, 39, and her daughter, Brielle, 21, were both present. The celebration was had a pink theme, respectively, and was filled with lavish flowers and table settings. Tristan and his mother were there to celebrate.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833\/http:\/\/hollywoodlife.com:80\/2018\/04\/09\/khloe-kardashian-baby-name-joke-andy-cohen-twitter-tweet","images":["data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.indiewire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/ta_603_112717_0753.jpg?resize=230%2C135","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/khloe-kardashian-name-reveal-twitter-ftr.jpg?w=620","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/heartbeat.pmc.com\/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F09%2Fkhloe-kardashian-baby-name-joke-andy-cohen-twitter-tweet%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3071284","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/khloe-kardashian-name-reveal-twitter-ftr.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/kansas-adidas-silvio-de-sousa.jpg?resize=230%2C135","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/the-americans-season-6-episode-3-philip-elizabeth.jpg?w=200&resize=230%2C135","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/kylie-jenner-puts-huge-post-baby-butt-on-display-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/shutterstock_951244dq-e1523490324149.jpg?resize=230%2C135","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/pixel.wp.com\/b.gif?v=noscript","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=15476338&cv=2.0&cj=1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/george-clooney-hoping-neri-oxman-brad-pitt-relationship-serious-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c9673a64e776066d542c0bc87ddf3530?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/blavatar\/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/wendy-williams-khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"],"top_img":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833im_\/https:\/\/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/04\/khloe-kardashian-name-reveal-twitter-ftr.jpg","keywords":[],"authors":["Jenna Lemoncelli","Entertainment","News Writer Reporter"],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180412061833\/http:\/\/hollywoodlife.com\/2018\/04\/09\/khloe-kardashian-baby-name-joke-andy-cohen-twitter-tweet\/","headline":"Did Khloe Kardashian Reveal Her Baby\u2019s Name?: See The Hilarious Tweet That Has Fans Shook","meta_data":{"description":"Did Khloe Kardashian just reveal her baby daughter's name in one single tweet?

In the Playoffs, Poole averaged 17 points per game and played a key role as the Warriors won their fourth NBA championship in eight years.\n\nThe impact Green\u2019s unprovoked attack will have on the Warriors this year in their defense of the title remains to be seen. The power forward is currently away from the team after coming to a mutual agreement that he would stay away for the forseeable future.\n\nMany NBA betting sites have the Warriors as the favourites to win the Western Conference and NBA Championship this season, but the dynamic could change following this recent scandal. Green is in the final year of his contract with the Warriors and is looking for the last big deal of his career; something the franchise may not be inclined to reward him with following this latest bout of indiscipline.\n\nA trade could still be on the cards, but it appears that the Warriors are committed to building around Poole in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he\u2019s in this position, about to sign a big (contract) extension \u2013 hopefully,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr after his first preseason appearance since the debacle. \u201cThe guy is tough. He\u2019s mentally tough. He\u2019s physically tough. He\u2019s ultra-confident in his game, and he showed it tonight.\u201d\n\nOne of the best betting sites, SportsBetting.ag, currently have Poole as the favorite to win the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award this season. Shooting guards have won this award in 16 of the last 18 seasons in the NBA, with bucket getters being the profile of player that the voters tend to go for.\n\nThe reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Tyler Herro, is a similar profile of player to Poole and both players are anticipated to sign comparible extensions with the franchises that drafted them in 2019. However, Herro has dropped to +1200 to retain his crown after he started during his only appearance in Miami\u2019s preseason schedule.\n\nPoole was ruled out of the running for Sixth Man of the Year last year after starting too many games to match the criteria due to Thompson\u2019s injury. Now that one half of the splash brothers is back healthy, Poole should return to his place as the first man of the bench while Thompson and Andrew Wiggins occupy the wing positions.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget narrative in all of this. Many NBA awards are won based on the narrative surrounding a player\u2019s season, and as much as Poole wouldn\u2019t have wanted this incident to happen, it will almost certainly lead to support in his corner.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake news"],"url":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/cnn-ratings-plunge-30-percent\/","images":["https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/themes\/joints-wp-master\/assets\/images\/blank.gif"],"top_img":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","keywords":[],"authors":[],"canonical_link":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/jordan-poole-300-to-win-nba-sixth-man-of-the-year","headline":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year","meta_data":{"viewport":"width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui","description":"If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.","robots":"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large","og":{"locale":"en_GB","type":"article","title":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year - yournewswire","description":"If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.","url":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/jordan-poole-300-to-win-nba-sixth-man-of-the-year","site_name":"yournewswire","updated_time":"2022-10-11T07:35:47+00:00","image":{"identifier":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","secure_url":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","width":800,"height":400,"alt":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year","type":"image\/jpeg"}},"article":{"section":"General News","published_time":"2022-10-10T15:09:23+00:00","modified_time":"2022-10-11T07:35:47+00:00"},"twitter":{"card":"summary_large_image","title":"Jordan Poole +300 To Win NBA Sixth Man Of The Year - yournewswire","description":"If you performed a Google search for Jordan Poole at this moment in time, his basketball skills and highlights will be pretty low on your immediate results.","image":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2022\/10\/Poole-2.jpeg","label1":"Written by","data1":"Dustin Williams","label2":"Time to read","data2":"2 minutes"},"msapplication-TileImage":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/54\/2024\/08\/cropped-cropped-ImportedPhoto.739916748.369245-270x270.png"},"movies":[],"publish_date":1665414563.0,"source":"https:\/\/yournewswire.com","summary":"","label":[0],"test":["fake news detection"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":null,"URL":null,"website":null,"seeds":null,"_date":null,"txt_nwords":null,"txt_nsentences":null,"txt_nparagraphs":null,"topic_k100":null,"topic_k200":null,"topic_k300":null,"mention_conspiracy":null,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":null,"FB_comments":null,"FB_reactions":null},{"id":null,"text":"ROCHESTER, New Hampshire \u2013 During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Bill Murray took a moment to praise Rochester, New Hampshire residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:\n\n\u201cWe were just leaving the city limits of Rochester, New Hampshire when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out.

I\u2019m gonna move there after I retire, \u201d Murray said with a laugh.\n\nMurray added later, \u201cYou have to understand, this is something that would\u2019ve never happened in L.A.!

Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent,\" the source claims. \"He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way.\"\n\n\"Angie was in a very bad place after [her] split [from Brad],\" the source adds. \"Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful.\"\n\nThe source says that Pitt has also moved on, and any possibility of him getting back together with Jolie is highly unlikely.\n\n\"People talk about them reuniting, but it will never happen,\" the source tells us. \"Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they've attempted therapy with the [six] children [they share], they can barely be in the same room together.\"\n\nET has reached out to Jolie's rep for comment.\n\nDespite the highly publicized breakup, Jolie appears to be enjoying her day-to-day life. In addition to her job as an actress, filmmaker and humanitarian, the brunette beauty has been spending a lot of quality time with Shiloh, Maddox, Vivienne, Zahara, Pax and Knox, the six kids she shares with Pitt.\n\nEarlier this month, she took a few of them to go see the new Tomb Raider reboot, which stars Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, the iconic role she originally played in 2001's Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and again in 2003 for the sequel, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. She's also been spotted out and about, doing normal, everyday activities, like grocery shopping.\n\nWhile Jolie has seemingly started to become comfortable on her own, Pitt (who's notoriously private), has become a changed man, going out more and enjoying time with close friends, an additional source told ET on Monday.\n\n\"He has made changes in his life since the split,\" the source said. \"When they first split, he spent a lot of time at home and was often very down about what was going on. He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, he\u2019s been going out more. He enjoys going out to eat with close friends.\"\n\n\"He's very private about who he\u2019s seeing, but he does continue to casually date,\" the source added. \"The women he sees are not in the public eye.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["fake

Benet may have reached a breaking point with Jay-Z and went looking for a fight with the rapper, who did throw some very direct shade at him on the first track of 4:44, according to a new MediaTakeOut.com report.\n\nJay made reference to Eric\u2019s alleged unfaithfulness to ex-wife, Halle Berry in Kill Jay-Z.\n\nThe rapper, real name Shawn Carter, raps: \u2018You almost went Eric

joked about Jay-Z owing him some royalties for the name dropped\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like yo, bro, where are my royalties?\u2019\n\nAt the time, he didn\u2019t seem annoyed by the name drop, in fact he said it was \u2018all love\u2019.\n\nHe\u2019s also been said to say that \u2018it\u2019s all love\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018But it\u2019s all love\u2026everything he makes is always fire, and once

ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.\n\nLaunch of the show will extend the presence of \u201cGMA\u201d to the network\u2019s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of \u201cToday.\u201d The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main \u201cGMA\u201d broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.\n\nThe new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace \u201cThe Chew\u201d with the new \u201cGMA\u201d hour.\u201cGood Morning America\u201d enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of \u201cGood Afternoon America\u201d between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.\n\n\u201cGMA\u201d makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival\u201cToday\u201d remains intense. \u201cGood Morning America\u201d remains TV\u2019s most-watched morning program, but \u201cToday, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, \u201cToday\u201d has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while \u201cGMA\u201d has notched 63,000 more viewers than \u201cToday\u201d overall.\n\nThe expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, \u201cGMA\u201d launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped \u201cGMA\u201d website that was not tied to ABC News\u2019 content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, \u201cGMA\u2019 senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. \u201cWe have so much content and a two-hour program isn\u2019t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,\u201d he toldVariety.\n\nHaines will leave \u201cThe View\u201d to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories.

grounding of the 737 MAX for more than four months after two deadly accidents has tarnished Boeing's reputation, but it still has the confidence of US policymakers.\r\n\r\nThis is despite the fact that one of the MAX flight systems, the MCAS, has been cited in both accidents.\r\n\r\nIs this an indication that the American aerospace giant is too big to fail?\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump, whose mantra is \"America first,\" certainly criticized Boeing early in his administration over the presidential plane, Air Force One, but he has been largely silent about the recent woes.\r\n\r\nThe wave of negative press about the flaws that caused the deaths of 346 people did not prompt legislators to summon Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg before Congress to inflict on him the kind of humiliation Wall Street bankers were subject to following the global financial crisis.\r\n\r\n\"Boeing is one of the engines of the US economy, it's way too big and too important for the United States,\" said Michel Merluzeau, an expert at Air Insight Research.\r\n\r\nIf American politicians were to attack the manufacturer, they would be shooting themselves in the foot, Merluzeau said, because \"there are many jobs involved, a very, very numerous supply chain and it cannot be replaced with Facebook or Google that don't produce anything tangible.\"\r\n\r\nFounded 103 years ago, Boeing employs more than 150,000 people around the world, the vast majority in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn addition to direct jobs, its subcontractors -- like General Electric (GE), United Technologies and Spirit Aerosystems -- are large US industrial employers.\r\n\r\nThe location of Boeing plants resembles a political campaign map, with facilities in Republican strongholds like Alabama, South Carolina and Texas, and Democratic areas like California and Washington, as well as states that helped Trump win the election: Pennsylvania and Arizona.\r\n\r\nAnd Muilenburg has shown political savvy in his picks for the company's board of directors, naming Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina and Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, and Caroline Kennedy, ally of former president Barack Obama and daughter of former president John F. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nBoeing is a dominant player not just in civilian aircraft but in the defense and space industries, and is a major supplier to the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nThe company produced the famous B-17 and B-29 bombers of World War II and the B-52 used the Vietnam War. Today it produces a variety of aircraft including the F\/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, Apache attack helicopters, the B-1 bomber and combat drones.\r\n\r\nIt also is part of SpaceX, which will manage travel to the International Space Station.\r\n\r\nAnd Boeing manufactures the presidential plane, the iconic Air Force One.\r\n\r\nBut Boeing also \"can be used as a strategic tool,\" said Arthur Wheaton, a professor at Cornell University in New York.\r\n\r\nChinese purchases of Boeing aircraft are part of trade negotiations with Beijing, according to a source, since that can be a fast way to reduce the US trade deficit.\r\n\r\nUS civilian aircraft exports fell 12 percent to $20.4 billion in May, due to the MAX crisis, which affected the GDP, according to government data.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"Is Boeing too big to fail?","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[1],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"M0bd31","URL":"https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20190804-boeing-big-fail","website":"france24.com","seeds":"big.foot","_date":1564876800000,"txt_nwords":529.0,"txt_nsentences":19.0,"txt_nparagraphs":18.0,"topic_k100":"k100_51","topic_k200":"k200_123","topic_k300":"k300_187","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":4.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"id":null,"text":"6 Manufactured Problems That Are Behind 6 Major Globalist Agendas\r\n\r\nProblem-reaction-solution, the Hegelian Dialectic is that process the globalist ruling class have chosen to use as the primary tool to constantly change society in the direction they want it to go. They manufacture a problem, focus on that problem, then sell the solution. The solution is always the very thing that drives their plan forward.\r\n\r\nIn this day and age the fundamentals of basic knowledge and awareness of what is happening in the world can be gauged by someone\u2019s awareness of the Hegelian Dialectic. If someone is not aware of this powerful tool used by the controllers it is likely they are not aware of a lot of other things. For this reason the basics of the Hegelian Dialectic cannot be underscored enough in explaining major agendas today. Let\u2019s look at 6 absolutely engineered problems today whose solutions play perfectly into the new world order plans. No one should mistake these for anything other than manufactured problems without which there would be no new world order. For this reason the following manufactured problems will never be solved. These manufactured problems are required and we should not expect them to go away any time soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe global warming movement has been debunked many times over by non-government\/non-IPCC funded scientists, researchers and critical thinkers all over the world. As a result of this, by the turn of the new century the movement had to change its name to the broader more generic \u201cclimate change\u201d. Here we are many years later and the earth never warmed like it was supposed to. But don\u2019t get any ideas. Those deeply committed to the climate movement will not be moved by facts or logic that interfere with their position on the matter. Meanwhile the controllers know that to admit that the planet is not warming would put the future of geoengineering in jeopardy. Government geoengineers for years have been planning the roll out of the geoengineering global operations to the general public and they know the only way to do is to justify it under the global warming \u201cproblem\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn this script they\u2019ve been working on for years, geoengineering is the \u201csolution\u201d to climate problems. Geoengineering, meaning the spraying of our skies with chemicals and the additional injection of our skies with chembomb aerosol massive plumes in conjunction with HAARP to manipulate the weather among other things.\r\n\r\nThis agenda is so important to the globalists that no movement has been more infiltrated with what I call cross-confusion, as much as the geoengineering movement. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen outright global warming hoaxers positioning themselves (in some cases) in perceived leadership positions just to lure those active in the geoengineering movement into alternate confusing narratives where in order to supposedly understand the problem of geoengineering the followers are being deceived into accepting the Al Gore, UN, CFR, Rockefeller, Club of Rome\u2019s long planned global warming hoax theories.\r\n\r\nIn this particular topic the globalists have thus attempted to create a two-layered deception, which goes something like this \u2013 The \u201cproblem\u201d (problem A) of global warming has led to the \u201cproblem\u201d (problem B) of geoengineering. But since global warming is real let\u2019s see how we can make the geoengineering a more responsible kind of geoengineering, or maybe we\u2019ll stop the geoengineering and use the stopping of geoengineering to confirm the need to address problem A, the global warming hoax. Does this remind anyone of the left-right paradigm where you have to pick the better of two evils?\r\n\r\n2 \u2013 ISIS creation funding and arming center of continued war on terror\r\n\r\nNo ISIS means no new world order. The globalists know this; so, as I suggested some time back, the primary goal for the global elite is to simply prolong the existence of ISIS and make them sound greater than they are. The logic we are told suggests that ISIS is a powerful always growing uncontrollable force and thus the solution to this problem is to keep and expand the war on terror, keep attacking other nations in the name of fighting ISIS, and continue being afraid of ISIS even if it means ignoring the fact that the U.S. and its NATO allies created, funded, armed and continue to arm and support ISIS.\r\n\r\nThis reminds us that the globalists will never let reality get in the way of their script. The script always comes first, then the interpretation of reality follows. Anyone bothered, disturbed or resisting this cultic reverse logic where the interpretation of reality is secondary to the customized version of their script opens themselves to being labeled a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d. Yes, the script to suppress knowledge and keep the masses in the blind has not changed, we all know the rest.\r\n\r\nAll over the nation the local police are sitting on tons of military gear given to them by the Federal government under the 1033 program of the 1990s. It\u2019s one thing to have military capability, it\u2019s another to actually show it off and get the masses accustomed to the police state so they can see what happens when you resist. We\u2019re talking mass conditioning which is very important to the new world order plans. They need a public which has learned to accept their submissive role at the hands of an aggressive, fully armed, federally militarized nationwide police state. In almost every police show of force which has followed the latest police shootings or injustice we\u2019ve seen suspicious provocateurs inciting violence. This is common in staged or co-opted revolutions and no one should be surprised. Sometimes the reason for the revolution may be genuine but the participants unfortunately don\u2019t realize how the likes of George Soros are funding many of these events forcing one to wonder how these revolutions fit the bigger picture. George W Bush summed it up best with the phrase \u201corder out of chaos\u201d. This is all part of their plan to destabilize nations including America, cause revolutions then role out THEIR solutions to the problems.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve all watched how the Obama administration has worked hard to manufacture the new propaganda cold war against Russia and Vladimir Putin who have not marched along with the globalist new world order plans and the Western debt-based dollar banking scheme. We all know the script by now. You don\u2019t play along with the Western banking cabal and you automatically get demonized. Russia knows full well how this works now after several years of propaganda, lies, accusations, territory wars in Ukraine, and the colossal failure of blaming Russia for the downing of MH-17 in 2014. The end result is that Russia has become the new bogey-monster in the eyes of CIA\u2019s Western mainstream media. The latest version of the ISIS psyop show propaganda even includes new suggestions that somehow Russia is with ISIS!\r\n\r\nWith few being fooled by this political foreign policy, CIA driven, 1950\u2019s style resurrected anti-Russia propaganda the script rolls on. The new \u201cproblem\u201d is Russia. This is the perfect manufactured problem to slowly lead us to the planned WW3 scenario the globalists have been thirsting for. This is \u201corder out of chaos\u201d to the third power and a very important part of the global Hegelian Dialectic staged \u201csolution\u201d to usher in their new world order.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve seen the periodic health and disease hysteria. They come and go before you even notice. Remember the Ebola hysteria of 2014? Did anyone ask the simple question \u2013 how and when did Ebola go away?? The answer is it didn\u2019t. CIA\u2019s mainstream media removed it from the news voluntarily. The virus is still real and nothing has changed. What we are seeing in these modern days is a mainstream media which has the power to insert something into your mind suddenly with 24\/7 media hyped coverage. When they do this, then the topic they are covering IS the story that you need to worry about. This same mainstream media, however, has the power to magically make that same topic disappear from your mind. The effect is magical and instant. That\u2019s right, when the mainstream media says the crisis is gone then it\u2019s gone regardless of what is actually happening.\r\n\r\nSo beware of the next medical crisis. When it comes it will be because the mainstream media decided it has come. They will also decide if and when the story will go away. During the next disease hysteria \u201cproblem\u201d expect them to use this tool to advance whatever agenda they have cooking. As the SB277 mandatory vaccination bill is on the verge of becoming law in California forcing all parents to subject their children to government dangerous and unproven vaccines, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this agenda is followed up by a new disease scare much worse than the not-so-scary measles hysteria of a few months ago or the 2014 Ebola mania.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind also that the control system is gauging the effectiveness of these early hype campaigns. They are measuring how the public is affected by these mainstream media 24\/7 hysteria campaigns and they are taking notes on how to improve the script for next time. Now more than ever is the time to be alert, vigilant and aware of this informational propaganda war for your mind and your body.\r\n\r\nFinally, the left wing section of the right-left globalist control system continues to push their Malthusian, elitist, Eugenics, master race planned problems of scarcity and overpopulation as well as the \u201ccarbon emission\u201d hysteria which all traces back to the failed global warming hoax of the Al Gore days. The \u201csolutions\u201d to these scripted problems of course line up perfectly with their need to control the world by taxing and monitoring all human behavior worldwide as the world moves toward \u201csustainable\u201d solutions. The U.N.\u2019s long planned Agenda 21 is a major part of the implementation of these solutions to these scripted problems. And, like all the other scripted problems above, anyone thinking critically, asking questions, exposing these agendas or pointing out what\u2019s wrong with these claimed problems or solutions is a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d.\r\n\r\nRemember you are not allowed to interfere with these scripts. The problem MUST exist for the solution to be implemented. The \u201csolution\u201d must be implemented exactly as planned for the new world order agenda to move forward as planned. Is there any part of this script that doesn\u2019t make sense to you yet?\r\n\r\nWhat we are now seeing is a growing segment of humanity which is reading and educating themselves on the simple truth behind the new world order. As we see things get much worse every day now we are all reviewing and recognizing how this works. Make no mistake, as we share this basic knowledge about the new world order plans the simple truth becomes easier and easier to see. Ironically, the more the control system offers resistance to this human awakening with counter deceptive stories, the more people wake up even if it\u2019s at the expense of those who are more blinded. If this story seems easier and easier to understand realize that this is the process of human intellectual evolution in motion.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, what we are finding is that it is becoming less and less difficult to convince people of these events occurring within our species. People are continuing to slowly but surely wake up. Part of this intellectual evolution and mass awakening phenomenon is that people are becoming less and less fazed by mainstream media lies. More than ever before the average awakened intellectual and discerning individual can watch a scary ISIS report or climate change report on the mainstream media news and literally not have their emotions or heart rate effected at all. The human brain is beginning to bypass the old lower brain physiological knee-jerk response that was supposed to be associated with these script scaremongering stories which the globalists relied on so heavily. I personally believe that the human species is essentially becoming better and more effective at detecting when it is being lied to. It\u2019s doing this for the sake of its own survival. (more on this topic another time)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s therefore continue sharing this information for information sake and realize this is having an impact on the species, our consciousness and ultimately our road to freedom; more importantly, freedom from the system of enslavement that threatens our current existence.\r\n\r\nBernie is a revolutionary writer with a background in medicine, psychology, and information technology.

But a recent death threat she received has crossed the line in a major way \u2013 and what\u2019s perhaps more chilling is the fact that law enforcement isn\u2019t really taking it all that seriously.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2018, Dr. Humphries reportedly received an email from an incognito lunatic who threatened to kill her. This alleged individual stated that he or she very soon plans to \u201cmurder\u201d Dr. Humphries with a Desert Eagle handgun. The threat contains a barrage of vulgarities and other vile language that\u2019s clearly intended to scare Dr. Humphries into stopping her work.\r\n\r\nA recent video published on We Are Vaxxed\u2018s Facebook page shows Dr. Humphries and her friend, Polly Tommey, discussing the threat. They can be seen reading a censored version aloud as they ask for prayers from their many followers.\r\n\r\nIn a private letter to VacTruth.com\u2018s Jeffry John Aufderheide, Dr. Humphries offered gratitude to her allies, many of whom have been interceding in prayer on her behalf. She wrote:\r\n\r\n\u201cDr Suz and Polly want you to know that we read and appreciate every scripture and prayer you have sent. We appreciate all the Godly and conventional support and advice we have been given. The enemy hates prayer more than anything. Prayer is stronger than the hatred of our enemies, and more powerful than the FBI, CIA, police, private detectives, all of which have been activated as well. Our minds are set on God, fearlessly, in faith, and we carry on.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe letter in its entirety is so horrific and vile that we won\u2019t republish the whole thing here. But some important snippets worth mentioning include:\r\n\u2022 An admission that the perpetrator knows where Dr. Humphries lives, and wants to make her death as gruesome as possible.\r\n\u2022 An admission that the perpetrator plans to emerge from a crowd of people in the street and \u201cblast\u201d Dr. Humphries in the chest.\r\n\u2022 A desire by the perpetrator to see Dr. Humphries on the ground \u201cflailing\u201d and \u201cbleeding out.\u201d\r\n\u2022 A promise by the perpetrator that he or she fully intends to achieve this goal by whatever means possible.\r\n\u2022 A claim by the perpetrator that Dr. Humphries\u2019 eventual death at his or her hands could have been avoided if Dr. Humphries had simply stopped telling the truth about vaccines.\r\n\r\nAre drug and vaccine companies behind this evil threat?\r\n\r\nWho could possibly say such things \u2013 and fully intend to go through with them? Dr. Humphries\u2019 labor of love in helping more parents see the light about the inherent dangers of vaccination has been a Godsend for many \u2013 but a nightmare for the vaccine industry.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why some suspect that this heinous threat may actually be the work of Big Pharma corporate hacks. An email written by a corporate executive at drug giant Merck & Co. openly admits that \u201cwe may need to seek them out and destroy them [doctors] where they live,\u201d referring to people like Dr. Humphries whose work is clearly bad for business.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that, as of November 15, 2017, at least 77 holistic doctors have turned up dead on suspicious grounds.

Bush in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the initiation of the Global War on Terror.\r\n\r\nThe report, authored in part by Seton Hall University School of Law Professor Mark Denbeaux, is entitled, \u201cHow America Tortures,\u201d and features never-before-seen illustrations drawn by Abu Zubaydah, depicting the brutal interrogation techniques utilized against him while in custody at CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d shortly after his capture and arrest in March 2002.\r\n\r\nZubaydah, a Palestinian-born man whose given name is Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, was wounded and captured in late March 2002 in Pakistan. He has long been alleged to be a high profile al Qaeda operative and was described by Bush following his capture as \u201cone of the top operatives plotting and planning death and destruction on the United States.\u201d Subsequent investigations have discovered that these allegations were false, yet Zubaydah remains indefinitely detained at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe report analyzes the so-called torture memos developed by the CIA outlining the specific techniques that were to be utilized against Zubaydah and other detainees in the Global War on Terror. The report also relies on descriptions of the torture techniques provided by Zubaydah, including illustrations drawn by him depicting his torture, as well as internal CIA documents, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report, and other government documents.\r\n\r\nThe so-called torture memos, which were prepared by the CIA in 2002, outline a now-outlawed interrogation program that utilized violence, extreme isolation, and sleep deprivation on detainees in order to extract information and confessions.\r\n\r\nOne of the recently released illustrations drawn by Zubaydah shows the man strapped down naked on a table with a hood covering his head. Water is then poured over his hooded head, simulating a drowning scenario. This \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d technique, often referred to as waterboarding, was later described by the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s study as \u201cbrutal and far worse than the CIA represented.\u201d According to the latest reports, Zubaydah was subjected to this torture technique over 80 times while in CIA custody.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey kept pouring water and concentrating on my nose and my mouth until I really felt I was drowning and my chest was just about to explode from the lack of oxygen,\u201d Zubaydah explained to his lawyer in a declassified report.\r\n\r\nZubaydah was also subjected to a variety of other brutal torture techniques, including prolonged periods of sleep deprivation, having his head slammed repeatedly into a wall, and being confined and isolated in boxes, including in a coffin-shaped box, restricting his movement. Zubaydah recounted that he had been kept awake at one point for \u201cmaybe two or three weeks or even more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt felt like an eternity,\u201d he stated, \u201cto the point that I found myself falling asleep despite the water being thrown at me by the guard.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe CIA\u2019s interrogation team videotaped many of the torture sessions, only to destroy them all in 2005 at the behest of Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, Zubaydah has not been officially charged or tried for any of his alleged crimes, and remains in federal custody indefinitely.\r\n\r\nZubaydah\u2019s legal team has brought cases before the European Court of Human Rights, whose member countries, including Poland and Lithuania, were at least partially complicit in the extraordinary rendition program that transported detainees such as Zubaydah to CIA black sites for these torture sessions.\r\n\r\nThe latest report demonstrates conclusively once again how far America has strayed from her principles as a result of the prosecution of the Orwellian Global War on Terror.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"New Seton Hall Report Expos\u00e9 Details of Bush Torture Program","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[0],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"C06a66","URL":"https:\/\/americanfreepress.net\/new-seton-hall-report-expose-details-of-bush-torture-program\/","website":"americanfreepress.net","seeds":"george.bush","_date":1577059200000,"txt_nwords":659.0,"txt_nsentences":22.0,"txt_nparagraphs":14.0,"topic_k100":"k100_47","topic_k200":"k200_3","topic_k300":"k300_248","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1069,"FB_shares":11.0,"FB_comments":2.0,"FB_reactions":2.0},{"id":null,"text":"Walgreens and Greater Than AIDS Partner with Health Departments and Local HIV Organizations Across the Nation to Offer Free Testing on National HIV Testing Day\r\n\r\nWalgreens and Greater Than AIDS are working with health departments, HIV\/AIDS service organizations, and other community organizations to provide free HIV testing and information at select Walgreens stores in more than 260 cities on National HIV Testing Day (NHTD), Thursday, June 27 between 10 am \u2013 7 pm (local time).

No appointment is required.\r\n\r\nThe use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications to prevent HIV transmission, as well as PrEP, a daily pill to protect against HIV, offer new pathways to ending HIV.

More than 48,000 free HIV tests have been provided since 2011 as part of the annual event.\r\n\r\nBioLytical Laboratories, Chembio Diagnostics, and OraSure Technologies, Inc. are contributing donated test kits and Abbott Rapid Diagnostics is providing support for outreach for the 2019 activation.\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of participating Walgreens locations and supporting partners for this year\u2019s National HIV Testing Day, as well as additional information about HIV testing, including year-round testing sites, visit www.greaterthan.org\/walgreens .\r\n\r\nWalgreens (walgreens.com), one of the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chains, is included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

This involved member currencies effectively floating within narrow ranges against the powerful German Deutsche Mark.\r\n\r\nBut it ended in humiliation for Major and Britain. Hedge funds and the Hungarian billionaire George Soros bet against the pound \u2014 and won.\r\n\r\nSept. 16, 1992 became known as \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d \u2014 a day that saw the British government humbled and seemingly out of control. Though the pound\u2019s exit from the ERM was an economic shock almost unparalleled in the post-war period, it was seen as a gift by the more euroskeptic, or by now euro-hostile, elements within the Conservative Party.\r\n\r\nThe growing tension with Europe was particularly evident during the mad cow's disease outbreak in Britain in 1996, which prompted Brussels to ban imports of British beef. Major sought to bring an end to the EU ban and eventually said Britain would no longer cooperate in EU business until it had been lifted. By June 1996, a framework to lift the ban was agreed but relations had clearly been strained.\r\n\r\nMajor didn't get any of the credit of the ensuing boom that was partly due to the lower pound following its exit from the ERM \u2014 he and his government would be forever tainted by what had occurred on Black Wednesday.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the pro-EU Tony Blair led the Labour Party back into government for the first time in 18 years, with as benign an economic backdrop as any new prime minister could possibly wish for.\r\n\r\nEuroskepticism appeared to be in retreat but behind Blair\u2019s landslide majority lay the first seeds of the 2016 Brexit vote.\r\n\r\nThe Referendum Party, founded and led by the billionaire James Goldsmith to promote another vote on Britain\u2019s EU membership, managed to get 2.6% of the total votes cast, mostly former Conservatives. It may not sound like much, but Goldsmith made a lot of noise.\r\n\r\nWhen the party disbanded after the election and Goldsmith died, the UK Independence Party took on the baton.\r\n\r\nBoy did it \u2014 and UKIP's then chairman Nigel Farage \u2014 run with it.\r\n\r\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https:\/\/www.apnews.com\/Brexit","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"Britain's EU Journey: When Major got an opt-out from euro","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[1],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"M1d6b1","URL":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/wireStory\/britains-eu-journey-major-opt-euro-68500265","website":"abcnews.go.com","seeds":"george.soros","_date":1579824000000,"txt_nwords":556.0,"txt_nsentences":23.0,"txt_nparagraphs":17.0,"topic_k100":"k100_6","topic_k200":"k200_100","topic_k300":"k300_253","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":0.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"id":null,"text":"The three leaders' meeting in Osaka last week came days after they got together to discuss mutually relevant issues on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, which took place in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek earlier in June.\r\n\r\nOver the past several years, Russia, China and India have all been adversely affected by growing tensions with the United States, especially after US President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and ended India's preferential trade status that allowed some of the South Asian nation's products to enter the US duty-free. In response, New Delhi imposed retaliatory duties on imports from the US.\r\n\r\nAddressing the trilateral meeting in Osaka, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"As developing economies, it is important that there is a discussion between us on the issues of economy, politics and defense.\" Modi also said that terrorism was a global challenge and must be effectively fought by the international community. India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar, tweeted a summary of Modi's speech during the talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia's foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, later said that the leaders also discussed multilateral challenges. \"All three leaders agreed that in an era of economic and global change, it is important to maintain the trend of globalization, a free rule-based trading system, to oppose tendency towards protectionism.\" The three also spoke about steps to tackle climate change and enhance counterterrorism cooperation.\r\n\r\nRead more: G20 summit 2019: Key questions and answers on Day 1\r\n\r\n\"After the US pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Change Accord \u2014 and given Trump's attitude toward the WTO and the sanctity of multilateral agreements in general \u2014 China, Russia, India and the developing world came together strongly in defense of the multilateral world order,\" political analyst Ravi Bhoothalingam told DW.\r\n\r\nThe meeting in Osaka, Bhoothalingam said, would help reaffirm their resolve to amicably settle their trade and technological issues with the US.\r\n\r\nAndrew Cainey, an Asia expert at the London-based Chatham House, told DW that the meeting \"highlights again the multipolar nature of the world today\u2026the world is not just G2 [the US and China].\"\r\n\r\nHowever, India and Russia would also seek to act in their own interests, crafting their own multilateral strategies with other nations, Cainey said. \"They can, no doubt, reach agreement on some issues: but their situations and interests are fundamentally different.\"\r\n\r\nIndia, for instance, would have to balance its relations with the US and China, while continuing to import defense equipment from Russia. Additionally, \"although they bemoan US 'protectionism,' these countries also have many protectionist attributes,\" Cainey said.\r\n\r\nChallenge for the US\r\n\r\nPolitical analyst Bhoothalingam said that following the trade-war rhetoric with China and India, Trump would \"probably come up with something that defuses the situation \u2014 at least for the time being.\" And as predicted, Trump agreed to resume trade talks with China and said that Washington would not levy tariffs on all remaining imports from China \u2014 more than $300 billion worth.\r\n\r\nThe US president also announced that American technology companies could again begin doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei, reversing a ban that was put in place in May.\r\n\r\nTrump also promised Indian PM Modi \"very big\" trade deals. The talks marked a significant shift from the US president's statements condemning India's retaliatory taxes on imports from the US. Trump also congratulated Modi on his election victory, saying, \"It is a fantastic tribute to you and your abilities.\"\r\n\r\nTrump's interaction with Russian President Putin was similarly friendly, with Trump playfully saying, \"Don't meddle in the election, president,\" as they spoke to reporters.\r\n\r\nChatham House expert Cainey says the US needs to understand the significance of its actions. \"The challenge for the US \u2014 or, at least for some US leaders and policymakers \u2014 is understanding that US actions create their own reactions and second-order changes.\"\r\n\r\nThe trilateral meeting, Cainey underlined, was indicative of a shifting post-war order, \"in part as a result of the rise of China and India, in part as a result of President Trump's actions.\"","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"Xi, Modi, Putin seek to strengthen multilateral world order | DW | 01.07.2019","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[1],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"M18ea3","URL":"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/xi-modi-putin-seek-to-strengthen-multilateral-world-order\/a-49428304","website":"dw.com","seeds":"new.world.order","_date":null,"txt_nwords":711.0,"txt_nsentences":28.0,"txt_nparagraphs":17.0,"topic_k100":"k100_84","topic_k200":"k200_78","topic_k300":"k300_31","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":17.0,"FB_comments":4.0,"FB_reactions":16.0},{"id":null,"text":"Though the organization today is among the most outspoken when it comes to drumming up mass hysteria over \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d \u2013 its homepage currently has a pop-up urging visitors to sign a petition to \u201cTell Congress to Push for a Green New Deal\u201d \u2013 Greenpeace wasn\u2019t always a shameless advocate for junk science.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the co-founder of Greenpeace Canada, Patrick Moore, recently spilled the beans during an interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, explaining that not only is global warming completely fake, but that it\u2019s also being used by social engineers around the world \u2013 including Greenpeace \u2013 to fear-monger the public in to giving up their rights and freedoms.\r\n\r\nSpeaking with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Moore held nothing back in revealing fear and guilt are being used as conversion tactics to draw more followers into the Cult of Climate Change \u2013 the endgame being to siphon as much cash from people as possible in order to implement a globalist system of governance in which nobody will be allowed to drive big cars, eat meat, use plastic, or in any other way \u201charm\u201d the planet.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear has been used all through history to gain control of people\u2019s minds and wallets and all else, and the climate catastrophe is strictly a fear campaign \u2013 well, fear and guilt \u2013 you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re killing your children because you\u2019re driving them in your SUV and emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and you feel guilty for doing that,\u201d Moore explained during his interview.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no stronger motivation than those two.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more news about the hoax that is global warming and climate change, be sure to visit GlobalWarming.Fetch.news and ClimateScienceNews.com.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreen\u201d companies are also a propaganda-driven fraud, Moore says\r\n\r\nBut what about all of the climate \u201cscientists\u201d who\u2019ve reached a \u201cconsensus\u201d that the earth is heating up because of cow farts, you might be asking?

She died in London, after having suffered a stroke, at 87 years old. Last December, she had undergone an operation to remove a growth from her bladder.\r\n\r\nKnown as the Iron Lady for her toughness, Thatcher had served as the United Kingdom\u2019s only female prime minister, leading her country from 1979 to 1990 as head of the Conservative Party.\r\n\r\nThatcher served longer than any other British prime minister in the 20th Century. She is remembered for her generally conservative views, including weakening trade unions, deregulating industries, divesting state-controlled parts of the economy, and taking a tough stance against Communism.\r\n\r\nThe latter efforts meant she was also often closely allied with Ronald Reagan\u2019s U.S. administration.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Thatcher\u2019s death, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \u201cThe Queen was sad to hear the news of the death of Baroness Thatcher. Her Majesty will be sending a private message of sympathy to the family.\u201d\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron, the U.K.\u2019s current prime minister, said: \u201cIt was with great sadness that l learned of Lady Thatcher\u2019s death. We\u2019ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great Briton.\u201d\r\n\r\nMargaret Thatcher led a long and intriguing political life, which got us thinking about some of the surprising things we learned about her along the way. Here is a brief list:\r\n\r\n1. Soviet Journalists Gave Her the Name \u201cIron Lady\u201d\r\n\r\nLong known as the Iron Lady (including in her 2011 biopic), Thatcher was given that memorable title by Soviet journalists, who had made \u201ca grudging testament to her ferocious will and determination,\u201d in the words of NPR.\r\n\r\nBefore she entered the tough world of politics, Thatcher was a research chemist. In her 20s she worked for J. Lyons and Co. as a food scientist, where she developed additives for ice cream. Her team \u201cdiscovered a method of doubling the amount of air\u201d in ice cream, which eventually found its way into soft serve products. (Updated based on a reader comment below.)\r\n\r\nEarning her science chops, Thatcher had majored in chemistry at Oxford for a BSc.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, in her first year of office as Britain\u2019s prime minister, Thatcher traveled to Japan for an economic summit. Not having hosted many female heads of state, the Japanese arranged to have 20 female karate experts escort her.\r\n\r\nBut Thatcher\u2019s Cabinet Secretary Sir John Hunt told the Japanese, \u201cMrs Thatcher will attend the summit as Prime Minister and not as a woman per se. The Prime Minister would like to be treated in exactly the same manner as the other visiting Heads of Delegation. If other delegation leaders, for example, are each being assigned 20 karate gentlemen, the Prime Minister would have no objection to this; but she does not wish to be singled out.\u201d\r\n\r\n4. Thatcher Did Her Own Cooking\r\n\r\nAlthough Thatcher was prime minister for 11 years, she didn\u2019t have a chef in her employ. Every night, she reportedly cooked dinner for her husband, Denis Thatcher, and she frequently cooked for cabinet members as well.\r\n\r\n5. Thatcher Said She Wouldn\u2019t Have Gone Into Politics in a Do-Over\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Thatcher told Conservative MP Lord Spicer, \u201cIf I had my time again, I wouldn\u2019t go into politics because of what it does to your family.\u201d\r\n\r\nThatcher\u2019s husband Denis died in 2003. Their son had gained a reputation for allegedly being a playboy.\r\n\r\nThatcher wasn\u2019t the first politician to remark on the challenges of being under constant scrutiny, and balancing work and home life.\r\n\r\nWhat were you surprised to learn about Margaret Thatcher?\r\n\r\nBrian Clark Howard covers the environment for National Geographic.

As in the case of Friday's fluoride announcement, today's sulfuryl fluoride limits came in the wake of a revised risk assessment the agency conducted after a 2006 National Academy of Sciences report urged it to consider dental fluorosis as a negative health consequence of exposure rather than a cosmetic impediment.\r\n\r\nDental fluorosis, which manifests as spotting on the teeth among children who consume too much fluoride as their mouths develop, can lead to long-term breakdown of the tooth enamel and other painful effects.\r\n\r\nThe gradual EPA removal of sulfuryl fluoride allowances will be subject to public comment before taking effect and include a three-year head start for significantly affected industries such as the cocoa and walnuts sectors.\r\n\r\nEstimating that the pesticide is applied to 100 percent of cocoa crops, EPA warned in its proposed phaseout that \"cocoa imports (which in 2009 were valued at approximately $1.2 billion) would be lost due to either destruction or refusal of shipments by warehouse operators\" unless businesses can develop a viable alternative to sulfuryl fluoride for cocoa fumigation.\r\n\r\nToday's EPA proposal also references multiple objections Dow had raised in previous years to arguments made by the advocacy groups behind the petition, suggesting that pushback from industry on the sulfuryl fluoride limits can be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nClick here (pdf) to read a pre-publication copy of EPA's proposal to phase out sulfuryl fluoride tolerances.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"EPA Proposes Phaseout of Fluoride-Based Pesticide","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[1],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"M166b0","URL":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/gwire\/2011\/01\/11\/11greenwire-epa-proposes-phaseout-of-fluoride-based-pestic-97414.html","website":"nytimes.com","seeds":"fluoride.water","_date":1294704000000,"txt_nwords":600.0,"txt_nsentences":15.0,"txt_nparagraphs":13.0,"topic_k100":"k100_40","topic_k200":"k200_13","topic_k300":"k300_2","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":388.0,"FB_comments":230.0,"FB_reactions":457.0},{"id":null,"text":"President Donald Trump has offered to maintain federal funding for Planned Parenthood if the group stops providing abortions.

Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus.\" That means, the correct use and disinfection of these spaces should kill the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Filtration systems are effective whether it is a chlorine or saltwater pool.\r\n\r\nThat's great news, but swimming in the pool isn't the whole story when it comes to diving into summer fun.

According to Agbios, an online database on genetically modified crops, more than 32 million acres in the United States has been planted with this type of GM corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany is following in the footsteps of several other EU countries\u2014Austria, Hungary, Greece, France and Luxembourg\u2014which have already banned it in spite of threats of sanctions from globalist groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCiting a move in Luxembourg in early April to ban the cultivation of MON 810, German Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner announced that the German government was taking steps to prohibit farmers from planting the corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two governments based their mandates on European studies that suggest a particular toxin, called Bt, added to the corn on a genetic level may be fatal to \u201cnon-target organisms,\u201d such as ladybugs. Ladybugs and other predator bugs eat pests such as moths and beetles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA symptom of modern agriculture, the heavy use of pesticides has resulted in a never-ending cycle, where good and bad insects are indiscriminately killed and the natural cycle is thrown out of balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorse still, German officials cited research showing that pollen from corn spreads much farther than previously thought. Since corn is pollinated by wind-borne pollen, the concern is that neighboring non-GM corn could become contaminated by genetic material from the Frankenfoods, which blow for miles in the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is substantiated by many organic growers, who contend that it is becoming more and more difficult to find truly heirloom, organic seeds that have not been tainted by genetically modified crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion there are just reasons to assume that the genetically modified [corn] MON 810 represents a danger for the environment,\u201d Ms. Aigner, a member of the conservative Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, told reporters. \u201cTherefore, the cultivation of MON 810 is now banned in Germany.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCritics of genetically modified foods have pointed to several studies, which indicate that foods modified in a laboratory at a genetic level can be hazardous to your health. One recent study in Europe has shown that GM corn fed to rats resulted in rampant infertility. Those that did reproduce suffered from low birth weights for offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the billion-dollar biotech corporation has responded by suing Germany over the ban. In the suit, Monsanto insists that its product, which has been approved by the EU, is \u201csafe to use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are disappointed and frankly, we don\u2019t believe that they have justification to warrant this,\u201d Brad Mitchell, a spokesman for Monsanto, told a U.S. newspaper. \u201cThey have cited unconvincing evidence that it is unsafe. . . . But the scientific committee of the European Union approved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EU has responded by saying that Germany is within its rights to ban GM corn, but has issued a threat saying it will block the German government if it uncovers evidence that Germany has banned GM corn because it is pursuing \u201cprotectionist trade measures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, even if Monsanto fails to overturn Germany\u2019s ruling, the U.S. based corporation can appeal to the global trade body, the World Trade Organization, which Germany is a member of.

Propofol was first tested clinically in 1977. When administered by intravenous injection, it quickly induced anesthesia, with fast and smooth recovery afterward. Animal studies, however, revealed the potential for severe allergic reactions. With subsequent reformulation of propofol into an oil-based emulsion, giving it a milky appearance, this challenge was overcome, and propofol gained widespread use as a key anesthetic agent.\r\n\r\nAs a general anesthetic, propofol initially is given at a relatively high dose to produce a loss of consciousness in the patient and then is infused continuously in smaller amounts to maintain an unresponsive state; this approach typically is used in patients who are undergoing major surgery. At lower doses, propofol acts as a conscious sedative (or procedural sedative), inducing a semiconscious state. The sedative effects set in and wear off quickly, making propofol an effective agent for inducing mild sedation in outpatient surgeries.\r\n\r\nSide effects of propofol include pain at the injection site, hypotension, hypertension, nausea, cough, tingling sensation, and itching Rare side effects include arrhythmia, convulsion, and cardiac arrest. Propofol interacts with numerous other drugs, including chloral hydrate, diazepam, fentanyl, and morphine; such interactions can increase the anesthetic and sedative effects of propofol, producing potentially dangerous effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression and slowing of heart rate. Cardiac arrest caused by interaction between propofol and multiple benzodiazepines was responsible for the death of American singer and songwriter Michael Jackson in 2009.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"propofol | Definition, Anesthetic, & Side Effects","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[1],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"M118e6","URL":"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/propofol","website":"britannica.com","seeds":"michael.jackson.death","_date":null,"txt_nwords":250.0,"txt_nsentences":11.0,"txt_nparagraphs":3.0,"topic_k100":"k100_15","topic_k200":"k200_45","topic_k300":"k300_18","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":0.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"id":null,"text":"A second person has died of Ebola on the Democratic Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda, raising fears the deadly illness could spread.\r\n\r\nThe artisanal miner died on Wednesday morning in the city of Goma, home to two million people, authorities said.\r\n\r\nMore than 1,600 people have died of Ebola in DR Congo since the outbreak began in August 2018 but those have been in more remote areas.\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization called it a global health emergency last week.\r\n\r\nIt is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has only been used four times previously - including the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016, and killed more than 11,000 people.\r\n\r\nThe latest victim came from the north-eastern province of Ituri but fell ill and was admitted to a health centre in Kiziba, on the outskirts of Goma, on 13 July.\r\n\r\nHe later developed symptoms of bleeding and bruising, and tested positive to Ebola on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nWhat is the situation in Goma?\r\n\r\nEbola is affecting two provinces of DR Congo - North Kivu and Ituri. Goma is the capital of North Kivu and lies just across the border from the Rwandan city of Gisenyi.\r\n\r\nUntil now, the virus has been mostly contained to more remote areas, mostly around Beni and Butembo, to the north of Goma.\r\n\r\nBut the AFP news agency is now reporting that 15 people in South Kivu province have been quarantined amid fears the virus is spreading further.\r\n\r\nA priest in Goma died from Ebola earlier this month. The WHO called it a \"game-changer\", but until now there had not been any further confirmed cases in the city.\r\n\u2022 Six steps to stop Ebola from spreading\r\n\r\nGoma is a transport hub so the latest death is of particular concern, as it is far harder to isolate patients and trace contacts in major cities, where highly mobile, large populations are living in close proximity.\r\n\r\nThere are fears the illness could spread into Rwanda as people travel between Goma and Gisenyi every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rwanda has not yet had any confirmed cases, it has set up an Ebola treatment centre and is preparing 23 isolation centres in case of any infections.\r\n\r\n\"Rwanda has made a significant investment in Ebola preparedness,\" WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week.\r\n\r\n\"But as long as the outbreak continues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there is a very real risk of spread to neighbouring countries.\"\r\n\r\nHow bad is the situation in DR Congo?\r\n\r\nMore than 2,500 people have been infected and two-thirds of them have died.\r\n\r\nIt took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000.\r\n\r\nAbout 12 new cases are being reported every day.\r\n\r\nIt is 99% effective and more than 161,000 people have been given it.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everybody is vaccinated - only those who come into direct contact with an Ebola patient, and people who come into contact with them.\r\n\r\nAnd some of those people refuse to take it.\r\n\r\nPeople give a variety of reasons for not taking it: they don't want to put any external liquid in their body; they have a religion that doesn't want them to take vaccines; they don't believe in Ebola or because they think they don't need it.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine, made by Merck, was developed during the epidemic in West Africa and has been available throughout the latest outbreak.\r\n\r\nIt has proven effective but is in relatively short supply so WHO recommended a second vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson to complement it.\r\n\r\nBut the DR Congo's Health Minister Oly Ilunga complained that the Congolese were being treated as \"subjects of experimentation\", reports Reuters, and he resigned over the issue.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn't the outbreak been brought under control?\r\n\r\nTackling the disease has been complicated by conflict in the region.\r\n\r\nSince January, there have been 198 attacks against healthcare workers or Ebola treatment facilities leading to seven deaths and 58 injuries.\r\n\r\nAnother major problem has been distrust of healthcare workers leading to about a third of deaths being in the community rather than at a specialist Ebola treatment centre.\r\n\r\nIt means those people are not seeking treatment and risk spreading the disease to neighbours and relatives.\r\n\r\nThere has also been difficulty tracking the spread of the virus.\r\n\u2022 New Ebola outbreak in DR Congo is 'truly frightening'\r\n\u2022 Large Ebola outbreaks new normal, says WHO\r\n\u2022 Ebola: How a disease is prevented from spreading\r\n\r\nIs the world doing enough to help?\r\n\r\nThe WHO has been clear for months that it has insufficient money to tackle the problem.\r\n\r\nIt had estimated that it needed $98m to tackle the outbreak between February and July.

The promise of new gadgets that allegedly allow you to surf the web hands-free, with nothing more than the power of your own mind may seem intriguing to some, but there are many concerns about the true price that comes with such an \u201cinteractive\u201d interface. Two of the world\u2019s most hated companies \u2014 Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 are leading the way towards a brain-computer interface that could change the way we use computers, but at what cost?\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, it was revealed that Microsoft filed a patent for a new technology described as a \u201cbrain control interface that decodes electrical signals from the brain to launch and operate apps and web browsers.\u201d The gadget in question would resemble a headband and would even detect when users wish to scroll or click.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\u2019s device would reportedly learn each user\u2019s individual brain behavior via an intricate algorithm \u2014 and could be used in everything from video games to modeling software or simple web browsers.\r\n\r\nIn other words, they want this mind-control software to be everywhere, and in everything.\r\n\r\nLast year, Facebook also confirmed that they were working on similar \u201cmind-control\u201d technology. It appears the tech companies are now racing to tap into the minds of their consumers at an even deeper level. Facebook reportedly has 60 engineers working on the project. \u201cWe\u2019re building further out beyond augmented reality, and that includes work around direct brain interfaces that one day will let you communicate using only your mind, although that stuff is pretty far out,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg commented.\r\n\r\nPlot lines such as this have been featured in many a Sci-Fi novel \u2014 and it rarely ends well in fiction, let alone real life.\r\n\r\nFacebook has already come under fire for using their current social media platform to manipulate their users. The social media giant has often used their tech to block users from seeing content that didn\u2019t align with their agenda \u2014 like articles published by Natural News.\r\n\r\nBut the madness doesn\u2019t stop at censorship. As The Guardian reported in 2014, Facebook conducted an experiment on 689,000 unsuspecting users by controlling what was present in their news feeds. Through a process dubbed \u201cemotional contagion,\u201d Facebook found they could influence their users\u2019 feelings making them feel more positive or negative at whim.\r\n\r\nFacebook has literally used their current technology to control people\u2019s emotions \u2014 what will happen when this corporation has their claws literally inside your mind?\r\n\r\nThis kind of technology sets the stage for the next wave of mind control \u2014 with massive corporations steering the wheel. It would be virtually impossible for the unquestioning user to know if what they \u201csee\u201d in the mind-computer interface is simply what the corporations want them to see or think.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it will be all too easy for tech giants like Facebook or Microsoft to control the news you hear and the advertisements you see, once they\u2019ve got a device that connects directly and effortlessly to your brain.\r\n\r\nSuch technological advancements are undoubtedly impressive; the thought of being able to operate a computer or talk to your friends without ever lifting a finger is fascinating, but ultimately, corporations looking to profit off your thoughts are not exactly trustworthy. Adopting mind-computer interfaces leaves one very question for consumers: Who is in control, you or the corporations? They are building these devices to serve themselves \u2014 and no one else.\r\n\r\nRead more stories about the latest controversies in tech at Glitch.news.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"The race to own your mind: Facebook and Microsoft rush to release brain-computer interface device for THINKING your way through the internet","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[0],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"C04c81","URL":"https:\/\/newstarget.com\/2018-09-10-facebook-and-microsoft-release-brain-computer-interface-device-for-thinking-your-way-through-the-internet.html","website":"newstarget.com","seeds":"mind.control","_date":1551657600000,"txt_nwords":624.0,"txt_nsentences":26.0,"txt_nparagraphs":14.0,"topic_k100":"k100_16","topic_k200":"k200_83","topic_k300":"k300_275","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1327,"FB_shares":0.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"id":null,"text":"Miguel Merecias-Lopez pleaded guilty of conspiracy to produce more than 10,000 fake IDs that were sold across America.\r\n\r\nThe fake document operation was operating in Woodburn, Oregon for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe Fraud Doc Ring communicated with customers using Facebook, email, Snapchat and in person, the plea deal states.

As alluded to above, according to a lengthy essay published on the Association for Physiological Science website, \u201cA growing body of evidence shows that rapid global warming can (and is) increasing violent behavior.\u201d\r\n\r\nReferencing numerous studies, they argue that people tend to get hot under the collar, and physically aggressive when the temperature rises to an uncomfortable level.

Scarce resources are also supposedly a factor in the rise of terrorism.\r\n\r\nThe academics also sound the alarm about ecomigration that could lead to conflicts with the local population, \u201cwhere entire groups migrate in response to the physical, economic, or political instability brought about by an ecological disaster.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClearly, there is a need, and indeed there are many ways, for psychologists to weigh in on the issue of climate change and its relation to violent behavior,\u201d the authors conclude.\r\n\r\nRead the entire exposition and draw your own conclusions.\r\n\r\nAs Natural News previously wondered, however about the so-called global warming consensus,\u201dThe issue isn\u2019t whether climate change is real or not, but whether we can continue to allow agenda-driven scientific dogma to direct academic research and public policy.\u201d (RELATED: Read more about the climate change movement at ClimateScienceNews.com)\r\n\r\nFor discussion purposes, could global warming have caused the mob violence last week at the University of California at Berkeley when conservative journalist Milo Yiannopoulos tried to deliver a scheduled speech?\r\n\r\nOr was it more likely the result of pre-orchestrated actions by anti-Milo, anti-President Trump anarchists allegedly paid by George Soros-funded groups to take to the streets?

They are quite intentionally devoid of detail. In that regard, of course, they are not supposed to be read as analytical remarks, but as diplomatic signals.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the most loud and clear signal contained above is a dig at President Trump.\r\n\r\nThis quickly follows Angela Merkel\u2019s highly fruitful meeting with President Putin on January 11th, after which both leaders confirmed that the Nord Stream 2 project would press ahead in spite of US sanctions. Chancellor Merkel also said that she hoped Russian-Turkish attempts to broker peace-talks would be successful, and announced that Libyan ceasefire talks would soon take place in Berlin. She also said that it was an \u201cimportant step\u201d that the Iranian government had admitted that the January 8th crash of Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 had been the result of an \u201cunintentional human error\u201d on the part of Iranian military personnel.\r\n\r\n2 more clear signals, delivered like knives to Dim Donnie\u2019s heart.\r\n\r\nWith the fallout from the Soleimani-assassination not yet settled, the temptation for European political and diplomatic figures to signal disdain for Trump by love-bombing Putin seems irresistible at the moment. It\u2019s like watching a few 16 year-old kids setting jealousy-traps for each other in your garden-variety teenage love-triangle. It\u2019s quite amusing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that Brandon\u2019s new smartphone is cooler than Jimmy\u2019s,\u201d says Ashley\u2026.\r\n\r\nOf course, we know it\u2019ll all be different next week, but middle-aged dads still find the silliness of it all comedic.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the seriousness of Trump\u2019s miscalculation concerning the Soleimani assassination, and the manner that his stance toward Iran has unfolded since then. Even Benjamin Netanyahu took pains to publicly distance himself from that decision, stating that Israeli politicians should stay out of the discussion. Given that the United Kingdom is the United States\u2019 most uncritically subservient ally, Boris Johnson\u2019s public criticism of Trump\u2019s threat to bomb Iranian historical and cultural sites was also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nWas this another signal?\r\n\r\nNot exclusively. While Johnson would not be in the least bit concerned about the prospect of a military skirmish around Hormuz resulting in fatalities, apart from its economic consequences, he is still proud of being a trained classicist \u2013 the prospect of bombing an ancient archaeological site probably offends his basic sense of human decency even more than the prospect of war itself.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, everyone is perfectly well aware that war with Iran could very well trigger a global economic depression, and that is the factor which principally determines the reactions of US-allies\u2019 to Trump\u2019s hair-brained belligerence toward Iran.\r\n\r\nAnd, regardless of the highly publicized personal antagonisms which have characterized Merkel\u2019s relationships with Putin in the past, Nord Stream 2 is still a no-brainer, with or without US sanctions. Liquefied natural gas exported from the US to the EU is 30% more expensive than Russian gas. It\u2019s just not competitive. It\u2019s that simple. The fact that the German government has decided to abandon nuclear energy, which currently accounts for 34% of German domestic electricity-production, makes this point even more crucial. In the long term, personal antagonisms are trivial \u2013 the bottom line will ultimately determine long-term policy.\r\n\r\nIn my younger days, I used to play chess in tournaments. Most ordinary, club-level, tournament chess-players will insist on the wisdom of the maxim that you should play the board, not the opponent. It doesn\u2019t matter who your opponent is, or what kind of personality they have. Chess is mathematics, not psychology. Play the board-position on its strategic merits, and forget about absolutely everything else. Play the board!\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian crisis was deliberately engineered, among very many other factors, in order to disrupt gas-transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 circumvents that point of rupture, so the US tries to shut it down with sanctions. That doesn\u2019t work either. The 30% price-differential is simply too wide for sanctions to disincentivize it.\r\n\r\nUnder the Obama administration, the US effectively lost geo-strategic control over Turkey and the Philippines. Those losses of territory were made possible only by massive blunders. Under the Trump administration, the US is in the process of gradually losing geo-strategic control over Germany, having already decisively alienated France, which will make it increasingly difficult to maintain any meaningful geo-strategic foothold in western Eurasia.\r\n\r\nBut then again, until 2016, liberal universalism was the ideological glue which held the western alliance together. Trump\u2019s election meant that it was always on borrowed time.\r\n\r\nWith these factors considered, we might ask how much difference the assassination of General Soleimani really made to US-EU relations. Yes, it was jaw-droppingly reckless and strategically pointless. Yes, it severely alienated many US-allies. However, from the perspective of the United States\u2019 continental European allies, we have to ask, was it merely an incidental moment of realization? We have to expect that the macro-economic fundamentals would have forced an epiphany sooner or later. The Soleimani assassination, as fundamentally reckless as it was, essentially did nothing to change the positions of any on the pieces on the geo-strategic chessboard. It merely acted as an incidental cognitive trigger, whereupon some of the players woke up to the board-position a little sooner.\r\n\r\nPadraig McGrath is a political analyst.

Check out the latest drought map of the state. Almost 100% of the state is in severe drought conditions. Many parts of the West are also experiencing drought, but California is ground-zero. This is a huge food growing region, and the state has just started restricting water to agriculture. This is a vast problem not only for the U.S., but the entire world, and there is no end in sight. California is a state with a population of nearly 40 million people. Some towns have been cut off, and some people are starting to store drinking water in their homes. This could spark a humanitarian crisis and a financial crisis. You cannot live or do business without ample supplies of water. California has a GDP of $2.2 trillion.

Will someone like the Federal Reserve step in and buy some time. Greece is a NATO country, and it just signed a gas pipeline deal with Russia. It\u2019s getting complicated. Will someone like the Federal Reserve step in and buy some time? Does the EU cough up the remaining 7.2 billion euro loan package to kick the can towards the cliff? Who knows, but end it will sooner than later.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve will not be raising rates, and it has reduced the growth estimates it had. Gregory Mannarino says, \u201cThe Fed cannot and will not be raising rates because it can\u2019t.\u201d He points to recent so-called core inflation rates just announced of .1%. Of course, it\u2019s much higher than that, but Mannarino says the Fed is only worried about the \u201ccore rate.\u201d There is no growth and if the Fed raised rates, it would implode the economy. And yet, the mainstream press says \u201cFed on track to raise rates this fall.\u201d IMF Head Christine Lagarde just publicly scolded the Fed and told them \u201cnot to raise rates\u201d because the economy was too weak. Then you have this out earlier in the week from the same USA Today that says \u201cBonds haven status gets shaky.\u201d Meanwhile, the AP reports in the same week \u201cEconomists don\u2019t fear rise in rates.\u201d Really?? Maybe someone should tell that to Christine Lagarde and the entire bond market the raising interest rates are not going to be a problem\u2014NOT.\r\n\r\nLooks like the GOP got a win in the secret trade deal. The House narrowly passed part of the trade deal. It is the so-called Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA. Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said, \u201cThe TPA is a process and not an agreement.\u201d Of course, he did not say and none of the other mainstream media (MSM) don\u2019t think a secret trade deal is a problem. Ryan also said the TPA is \u201cmore accountable and more transparent.\u201d Yes, \u201cmore transparent\u201d that\u2019s why it is being done in secret. Congressmen and Senators have to go into a room alone and read hundreds of pages. It is illegal for the public to see the deal until it is passed. There is an old saying, and that is \u201cevil is done in the dark and good is done in the light.\u201d This is being done in the dark.\r\n\r\nJoin Greg Hunter as he analyzes these stories and more in the Weekly News Wrap-Up.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"CA Drought Worst Ever, Greek Debt Crisis Latest, Fed Cannot Raise Rates, Secret Trade Deal Advances-WNW 195 | Greg Hunter's USAWatchdog","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[0],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"C0001d","URL":"https:\/\/usawatchdog.com\/ca-drought-worst-ever-greek-debt-crisis-latest-fed-cannot-raise-rates-secret-trade-deal-advances-wnw-195\/","website":"usawatchdog.com","seeds":"fluoride.water; pharmaceutical.industry","_date":null,"txt_nwords":750.0,"txt_nsentences":52.0,"txt_nparagraphs":5.0,"topic_k100":"k100_75","topic_k200":"k200_128","topic_k300":"k300_4","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1548,"FB_shares":0.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"id":null,"text":"Imagine, for a moment, that a prominent media outlet in Iran decided to produce a story about the trials of being an Iranian spy in this technological day and age\u2014in which the all-pervasiveness of surveillance mechanisms and social media complicates slightly the process of entering other countries under false identities.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that the United States would find this less than entertaining, and that a fair amount of ruckus would ensue, with concerned politicians and other fearmongers bleating about terror attacks and the sanctity of US borders.\r\n\r\nOf course, no Iranian media outlet has actually done this. NPR\u2019s Morning Edition (1\/3\/19), on the other hand, has just run an upbeat segment on how violating other people\u2019s borders is now a tad more challenging for American spies than it was in past decades: \u201cCIA Chief Pushes For More Spies Abroad; Surveillance Makes That Harder,\u201d reported by Greg Myre.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cpush,\u201d in fact, came in September, when CIA Director Gina Haspel\u2014herself a former longtime undercover officer abroad\u2014announced her desire for a \u201clarger foreign footprint\u201d for the CIA. Four months later, it\u2019s the hook for NPR\u2019s human interest story on frustrating impediments to spying.\r\n\r\nMyre brings in various characters to populate his narrative, all of them current or ex-CIA employees. First is Jonna Mendez, former CIA \u201cchief of disguise,\u201d whom Myre tells us will give us \u201ca few key tips\u201d for Americans trying to appear European:\r\n\r\n[Europeans] wear their wedding rings on different fingers. They eat differently than we do. They don\u2019t shuttle that fork back and forth\u2026. They stand up straight.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s retired CIA officer John Sipher, who \u201csays it could be tough today to enter the same country twice with different sets of documents.\u201d Things were much easier back in the 1980s, we\u2019re told, when airports didn\u2019t scan faces and fingerprints, and everyone wasn\u2019t online.\r\n\r\nNext up with some remarks on social media are Sheronda, the CIA\u2019s chief of recruiting, and Mary, an undercover officer. Incidentally, Sheronda\u2019s soundbite\u2014\u201cPeople here do use social media. And yes, specific guidelines are provided\u201d\u2014is the same one that appeared in Myre\u2019s March 2018 NPR report \u201cCIA Recruiting: The Rare Topic the Spy Agency Likes to Talk About\u201d (3\/26\/18), which might as well have been titled \u201cHey Kids! Here\u2019s How to Join the CIA.\u201d\r\n\r\nMyre\u2019s latest pro bono public relations effort on behalf of the agency meanwhile ends on some thoughts about how all the technology in the world can\u2019t replace \u201cthe human touch\u201d when it comes to intelligence gathering. \u201cIt\u2019s a job of human beings,\u201d says Mendez.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the following question: Why is NPR trying so hard to humanize an organization that is downright anti-human? After all, it\u2019s not like the CIA\u2019s machinations abroad are restricted to wedding ring protocol, fork-shuttling and improved posture\u2014and a few details from its sordid history might have helped to contextualize Haspel\u2019s current CIA proliferation scheme.\r\n\r\nAmong the major milestones on the agency\u2019s timeline are, of course, the 1953 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Iran\u2019s Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstatement of the brutal shah\u2014an obsessive purchaser of US weapons\u2014and the 1954 coup against Guatemala\u2019s Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, which helped set the stage for a long and gruesome war that killed or disappeared over 200,000 Guatemalans. (The CIA\u2019s training of Guatemalan death squads is still bearing consequences in the form of waves of refugees fleeing that country\u2019s ongoing violence\u2014The Nation, 1\/3\/19.)\r\n\r\nAlso in Central America, the CIA was instrumental in the bloody Contra campaign of the 1980s\u2014what Noam Chomsky has referred to as \u201ca large-scale terrorist war against Nicaragua.\u201d The war effort was also aided by top Honduran drug lord Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros, owner of the Contra supply airline SETCO\u2014which, scholar Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz recalls in her Contra war memoir, Blood on the Border, was known as the \u201cCIA airline.\u201d Around the same time, a CIA-trained elite death squad by the name of Battalion 316 \u201cstalked, kidnapped, tortured and murdered hundreds of Honduran men and women\u201d\u2014as the Baltimore Sun (6\/13\/95) put it\u2014effectively \u201cterroriz[ing] Honduras for much of the 1980s.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, the CIA reportedly devised no fewer than 638 ways to kill Fidel Castro\u2014one of them, recalled by the Guardian (8\/2\/06), was inspired by Castro\u2019s fondness for scuba diving and involved \u201cinvest[ment] in a large volume of Caribbean mollusks\u201d: \u201cThe idea was to find a shell big enough to contain a lethal quantity of explosives, which would then be painted in colors lurid and bright enough to attract Castro\u2019s attention when he was underwater.\u201d An impressive allocation of time and resources, indeed.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the CIA conducted LSD experiments on unwitting US citizens in the 1950s\u2014and, speaking of drugs, the agency has often been up to its ears in them (despite that whole drug war the US perennially professes to be waging). A 1993 article in the International Herald Tribune (12\/3\/93) observed that, while \u201cCIA ties to international drug trafficking date to the Korean War,\u201d nowhere was the organization \u201cmore closely tied to drug traffic than it was in Pakistan during the Afghan War.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the devastating US war on Vietnam and neighboring countries, the Herald Tribune article specified, heroin refined in Laos was \u201cferried out on the planes of the CIA\u2019s front airline, Air America.\u201d A 2009 post by historian John Prados at the National Security Archive (8\/26\/09) confirmed that the \u201cagency\u2019s broad span of activities reached into virtually every aspect of the Indochina war,\u201d as the CIA \u201cactually conducted a full-scale war in Laos and ran a variety of paramilitary programs in South Vietnam.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe list goes on. But the point, in short, is that many global inhabitants would presumably not grieve too terribly if modern-day surveillance were to complicate the CIA\u2019s drive for a \u201clarger foreign footprint.\u201d\r\n\r\nNor should we forget the CIA\u2019s contemporary history of extraordinary rendition and torture\u2014a track record that leads us to Haspel herself. As Lisa Hajjar, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the author of Torture: A Sociology of Violence and Human Rights, wrote for The Nation (3\/16\/18): Haspel \u201cplayed a leading role in the agency\u2019s program of torture, kidnapping and forced disappearance during the [George W.] Bush administration.\u201d Most specifically, Haspel \u201coversaw the interrogation and torture of a Saudi national named Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri\u201d at a black site in Thailand in 2002.\r\n\r\nBut back to NPR\u2014which, as it so happens, is not the hugest fan of the T-word. In 2009, then\u2013NPR vice president for news Ellen Weiss denied reports that the outlet had banned the use of the word \u201ctorture\u201d altogether:\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s doubtless thanks to these guidelines that we end up with, for example, an NPR dispatch (2\/25\/15) on the US Senate\u2019s 2014 CIA torture report in which \u201ctorture\u201d appears a total of two times. The first is in the introductory sentence: \u201cFor years in the military courtroom at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, there\u2019s been a subject no one could talk about: torture.\u201d Lest anyone think that we\u2019re now going to talk about it, the only other reference is to \u201cwhat many call \u2018the torture report.\u2019\u201d NPR did, however, manage to describe in less \u201cloaded language\u201d one Guant\u00e1namo defendant\u2019s chronic bleeding on account of overzealous rectal examination by the CIA\u2014but, again, it\u2019s important not to take sides.\r\n\r\nIn Myre\u2019s segment, Jonna Mendez says that one of her responsibilities as the former CIA chief of disguise was to \u201cde-Americanize\u201d spies. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, it seems torture and other misdeeds are as American as apple pie; ditto, apparently, for media whitewashing of nefarious intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\n*This article was originally published on fair.","TR":null,"AG":null,"objetivo":null,"task":["conspiracy"],"url":null,"images":null,"top_img":null,"keywords":null,"authors":null,"canonical_link":null,"headline":"A Tough Time to Be a Spy, NPR Reports","meta_data":null,"movies":null,"publish_date":null,"source":null,"summary":null,"label":[0],"test":["conspiracy detection in articles"],"title":null,"media":null,"meme_text":null,"media_type":null,"text_TikTok":null,"doc_id":"C03862","URL":"https:\/\/ahtribune.com\/us\/2768-npr-spy.html","website":"ahtribune.com","seeds":"cancer","_date":null,"txt_nwords":1381.0,"txt_nsentences":47.0,"txt_nparagraphs":21.0,"topic_k100":"k100_63","topic_k200":"k200_126","topic_k300":"k300_241","mention_conspiracy":0.0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1395,"FB_shares":1.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":1.0},{"id":null,"text":"Two of China\u2019s major telecoms have successfully built several 5G masts Mount Everest to show how telecoms can operate under extreme conditions, it was reported.\r\n\r\nHuawei and China Mobile built the world\u2019s highest 5G network, commemorating the anniversary of two major Chinese milestones in mountaineering.\r\n\r\nFive 5G AAU base stations were built on the mountain at its Base, Transition and Forward Camps at 5,300, 5,800 and 6,500 metres above sea level, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe base stations aim to demonstrate the efficacy of Huawei\u2019s compact and integrated access points, with the Chinese tech firm announcing its base stations can offer 20 times the networking capacity while being three times smaller than a traditional ones.\r\n\r\nThe stations will offer download speeds of over 1.7Gbps (1,700 megabytes) and upload speeds of 215Mbps, even at 6,500 metres above sea level, and will be used to measure Mount Everest along with several specialists stationed on the mountain.\r\n\r\nCompact base stations reduce the time and work needed for installations, with smaller footprints boosting the number of sites in an area.

That wide body jets flew into the twin towers and completely destroyed them. Let me repeat that: Passenger planes (large hollow aluminum tubes) flew into industrial steel, marble and concrete sky scrapers, and caused them to turn into a pile of dust. And the worst part about this fairy tale is that we, the American people believed it. Now, nine years later, it's time to wake up from your slumber and take a good hard look at what did and did not happen on that fateful day. The conventional explanation we were provided, by government and media, for a top-down highly destructive gravitational collapse, in near-free-fall times, is physically impossible, and is thus about as worthy of discussion as is the belief that the Earth is flat.\r\n\r\nFICTION: Passenger jets flew into the Twin Towers, and the burning jet fuel caused them to collapse.\r\n\r\nFACT: The Twin Towers did not collapse. They suffered a mid-air pulverization due to an extreme unconventional energy source that caused the initial upward trajectory of so much of the towers' mass during the 'collapses' as (supposedly only) gravity was pulling them down.\r\n\r\nThe burning jet fuel melted all of the steel beams causing the buildings to collapse directly onto their own footprint.\r\n\r\nFACT: 80% of each of the towers 50 million ton mass NEVER hit the ground. The steel did not melt, but turned into nano-dust. Pulverization + Molecular Dissociation = Ground Zero Evidence. When matter is elevated to temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, results. Molecular Dissociation (MD) is easy to understand once we realize that there are four (4) states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Just as ice has trouble surviving in water or steam, molecules have trouble surviving in plasma, which is highly energetic (ie, hot). When molecules dissociate, they leave behind loose atoms and fragments of molecules. In other words, small particles. In this sense, it is correct to think of molecular dissociation as disintegration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving occurred at Ground Zero in New York City, we have a very strong indication that only exotic, unconventional weaponry could have released that much extremely -- unimaginably -- high intensity energy which suddenly appeared just as the towers disintegrated from top to bottom. This understanding means we cannot blame the highly unconventional Ground Zero devastation on thermite\/thermate\/super thermate and \"controlled demolition\" any more than we can blame it on \"jet fuel\" or \"box cutters\".\r\n\r\nIn a \"pancake collapse\" the rubble pile should be at least 1\/8 of the original building height (12.5%). The actual rubble pile was no more than 2% of the original building height. Both towers went \"poof.\"\r\n\r\nSo where did these 110 story tall 50 million ton sky scrapers go?\r\n\r\nThey were turned into nano-dust and 80% of the \"dust\" floated off into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: A huge steel beam from the south tower falters, turns to \"dust\" and blows away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat only exotic, unconventional weaponry could have released that much extremely -- unimaginably -- high intensity energy to cause the pulverization and molecular dissociation of these buildings, let's look at some of the other unexplainable anomalies..\r\n\r\nAll of these cars have unexplainable similar damage: Paint gone, instant rusting, and all of their door handles and engine blocks are missing!\r\n\r\nA squad car on FDR drive with wilted doors, burned paint, instant rust and no door handles or engine block.\r\n\r\nStrange fires appear to be attracted to the engine blocks, while the gas tanks and nearby paper are not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuildings a few blocks away,had mysterious holes in the windows, and the front marble fa\u00e7ade is completely gone, but no other damage.\r\n\r\nFor months we witnessed trucks coming and going from Ground Zero and the media told us they were hauling away the steel. What steel? There was very little steel left in the rubble because it had been pulverized into nano-dust. So what were these trucks really hauling back and forth? Dirt! They hauled in dirt, spread it all over Ground Zero, then scooped it up and hauled it away, and this went on for years. Didn't they do that at Chernobyl? Yes they did!\r\n\r\nSo now you know what didn't cause the buildings to \"vanish.\" Planes, jet fuel and thermite are irrelevant. So what kind of unconventional energy could have caused the Twin Towers to turn to dust? A fissionless fusion thermo nuclear event? Direct Energy Weapons? HAARP? A scaled up weaponized version of The Hutchison Effect?
