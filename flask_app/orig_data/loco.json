Kennedy.\r\n\r\nBoeing is a dominant player not just in civilian aircraft but in the defense and space industries, and is a major supplier to the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nThe company produced the famous B-17 and B-29 bombers of World War II and the B-52 used the Vietnam War.

They manufacture a problem, focus on that problem, then sell the solution. The solution is always the very thing that drives their plan forward.\r\n\r\nIn this day and age the fundamentals of basic knowledge and awareness of what is happening in the world can be gauged by someone\u2019s awareness of the Hegelian Dialectic. If someone is not aware of this powerful tool used by the controllers it is likely they are not aware of a lot of other things. For this reason the basics of the Hegelian Dialectic cannot be underscored enough in explaining major agendas today. Let\u2019s look at 6 absolutely engineered problems today whose solutions play perfectly into the new world order plans. No one should mistake these for anything other than manufactured problems without which there would be no new world order. For this reason the following manufactured problems will never be solved. These manufactured problems are required and we should not expect them to go away any time soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe global warming movement has been debunked many times over by non-government\/non-IPCC funded scientists, researchers and critical thinkers all over the world. As a result of this, by the turn of the new century the movement had to change its name to the broader more generic \u201cclimate change\u201d. Here we are many years later and the earth never warmed like it was supposed to. But don\u2019t get any ideas. Those deeply committed to the climate movement will not be moved by facts or logic that interfere with their position on the matter. Meanwhile the controllers know that to admit that the planet is not warming would put the future of geoengineering in jeopardy. Government geoengineers for years have been planning the roll out of the geoengineering global operations to the general public and they know the only way to do is to justify it under the global warming \u201cproblem\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn this script they\u2019ve been working on for years, geoengineering is the \u201csolution\u201d to climate problems. Geoengineering, meaning the spraying of our skies with chemicals and the additional injection of our skies with chembomb aerosol massive plumes in conjunction with HAARP to manipulate the weather among other things.\r\n\r\nThis agenda is so important to the globalists that no movement has been more infiltrated with what I call cross-confusion, as much as the geoengineering movement. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen outright global warming hoaxers positioning themselves (in some cases) in perceived leadership positions just to lure those active in the geoengineering movement into alternate confusing narratives where in order to supposedly understand the problem of geoengineering the followers are being deceived into accepting the Al Gore, UN, CFR, Rockefeller, Club of Rome\u2019s long planned global warming hoax theories.\r\n\r\nIn this particular topic the globalists have thus attempted to create a two-layered deception, which goes something like this \u2013 The \u201cproblem\u201d (problem A) of global warming has led to the \u201cproblem\u201d (problem B) of geoengineering. But since global warming is real let\u2019s see how we can make the geoengineering a more responsible kind of geoengineering, or maybe we\u2019ll stop the geoengineering and use the stopping of geoengineering to confirm the need to address problem A, the global warming hoax. Does this remind anyone of the left-right paradigm where you have to pick the better of two evils?\r\n\r\n2 \u2013 ISIS creation funding and arming center of continued war on terror\r\n\r\nNo ISIS means no new world order. The globalists know this; so, as I suggested some time back, the primary goal for the global elite is to simply prolong the existence of ISIS and make them sound greater than they are. The logic we are told suggests that ISIS is a powerful always growing uncontrollable force and thus the solution to this problem is to keep and expand the war on terror, keep attacking other nations in the name of fighting ISIS, and continue being afraid of ISIS even if it means ignoring the fact that the U.S. and its NATO allies created, funded, armed and continue to arm and support ISIS.\r\n\r\nThis reminds us that the globalists will never let reality get in the way of their script. The script always comes first, then the interpretation of reality follows. Anyone bothered, disturbed or resisting this cultic reverse logic where the interpretation of reality is secondary to the customized version of their script opens themselves to being labeled a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d. Yes, the script to suppress knowledge and keep the masses in the blind has not changed, we all know the rest.\r\n\r\nAll over the nation the local police are sitting on tons of military gear given to them by the Federal government under the 1033 program of the 1990s. It\u2019s one thing to have military capability, it\u2019s another to actually show it off and get the masses accustomed to the police state so they can see what happens when you resist. We\u2019re talking mass conditioning which is very important to the new world order plans. They need a public which has learned to accept their submissive role at the hands of an aggressive, fully armed, federally militarized nationwide police state. In almost every police show of force which has followed the latest police shootings or injustice we\u2019ve seen suspicious provocateurs inciting violence. This is common in staged or co-opted revolutions and no one should be surprised. Sometimes the reason for the revolution may be genuine but the participants unfortunately don\u2019t realize how the likes of George Soros are funding many of these events forcing one to wonder how these revolutions fit the bigger picture. George W Bush summed it up best with the phrase \u201corder out of chaos\u201d. This is all part of their plan to destabilize nations including America, cause revolutions then role out THEIR solutions to the problems.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve all watched how the Obama administration has worked hard to manufacture the new propaganda cold war against Russia and Vladimir Putin who have not marched along with the globalist new world order plans and the Western debt-based dollar banking scheme. We all know the script by now. You don\u2019t play along with the Western banking cabal and you automatically get demonized. Russia knows full well how this works now after several years of propaganda, lies, accusations, territory wars in Ukraine, and the colossal failure of blaming Russia for the downing of MH-17 in 2014. The end result is that Russia has become the new bogey-monster in the eyes of CIA\u2019s Western mainstream media. The latest version of the ISIS psyop show propaganda even includes new suggestions that somehow Russia is with ISIS!\r\n\r\nWith few being fooled by this political foreign policy, CIA driven, 1950\u2019s style resurrected anti-Russia propaganda the script rolls on. The new \u201cproblem\u201d is Russia. This is the perfect manufactured problem to slowly lead us to the planned WW3 scenario the globalists have been thirsting for. This is \u201corder out of chaos\u201d to the third power and a very important part of the global Hegelian Dialectic staged \u201csolution\u201d to usher in their new world order.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve seen the periodic health and disease hysteria. They come and go before you even notice. Remember the Ebola hysteria of 2014? Did anyone ask the simple question \u2013 how and when did Ebola go away?? The answer is it didn\u2019t. CIA\u2019s mainstream media removed it from the news voluntarily. The virus is still real and nothing has changed. What we are seeing in these modern days is a mainstream media which has the power to insert something into your mind suddenly with 24\/7 media hyped coverage. When they do this, then the topic they are covering IS the story that you need to worry about. This same mainstream media, however, has the power to magically make that same topic disappear from your mind. The effect is magical and instant. That\u2019s right, when the mainstream media says the crisis is gone then it\u2019s gone regardless of what is actually happening.\r\n\r\nSo beware of the next medical crisis. When it comes it will be because the mainstream media decided it has come. They will also decide if and when the story will go away. During the next disease hysteria \u201cproblem\u201d expect them to use this tool to advance whatever agenda they have cooking. As the SB277 mandatory vaccination bill is on the verge of becoming law in California forcing all parents to subject their children to government dangerous and unproven vaccines, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this agenda is followed up by a new disease scare much worse than the not-so-scary measles hysteria of a few months ago or the 2014 Ebola mania.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind also that the control system is gauging the effectiveness of these early hype campaigns. They are measuring how the public is affected by these mainstream media 24\/7 hysteria campaigns and they are taking notes on how to improve the script for next time. Now more than ever is the time to be alert, vigilant and aware of this informational propaganda war for your mind and your body.\r\n\r\nFinally, the left wing section of the right-left globalist control system continues to push their Malthusian, elitist, Eugenics, master race planned problems of scarcity and overpopulation as well as the \u201ccarbon emission\u201d hysteria which all traces back to the failed global warming hoax of the Al Gore days. The \u201csolutions\u201d to these scripted problems of course line up perfectly with their need to control the world by taxing and monitoring all human behavior worldwide as the world moves toward \u201csustainable\u201d solutions. The U.N.\u2019s long planned Agenda 21 is a major part of the implementation of these solutions to these scripted problems. And, like all the other scripted problems above, anyone thinking critically, asking questions, exposing these agendas or pointing out what\u2019s wrong with these claimed problems or solutions is a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d.\r\n\r\nRemember you are not allowed to interfere with these scripts. The problem MUST exist for the solution to be implemented. The \u201csolution\u201d must be implemented exactly as planned for the new world order agenda to move forward as planned. Is there any part of this script that doesn\u2019t make sense to you yet?\r\n\r\nWhat we are now seeing is a growing segment of humanity which is reading and educating themselves on the simple truth behind the new world order. As we see things get much worse every day now we are all reviewing and recognizing how this works. Make no mistake, as we share this basic knowledge about the new world order plans the simple truth becomes easier and easier to see. Ironically, the more the control system offers resistance to this human awakening with counter deceptive stories, the more people wake up even if it\u2019s at the expense of those who are more blinded. If this story seems easier and easier to understand realize that this is the process of human intellectual evolution in motion.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, what we are finding is that it is becoming less and less difficult to convince people of these events occurring within our species. People are continuing to slowly but surely wake up. Part of this intellectual evolution and mass awakening phenomenon is that people are becoming less and less fazed by mainstream media lies. More than ever before the average awakened intellectual and discerning individual can watch a scary ISIS report or climate change report on the mainstream media news and literally not have their emotions or heart rate effected at all. The human brain is beginning to bypass the old lower brain physiological knee-jerk response that was supposed to be associated with these script scaremongering stories which the globalists relied on so heavily. I personally believe that the human species is essentially becoming better and more effective at detecting when it is being lied to. It\u2019s doing this for the sake of its own survival. (more on this topic another time)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s therefore continue sharing this information for information sake and realize this is having an impact on the species, our consciousness and ultimately our road to freedom; more importantly, freedom from the system of enslavement that threatens our current existence.\r\n\r\nBernie is a revolutionary writer with a background in medicine, psychology, and information technology.

He has long been alleged to be a high profile al Qaeda operative and was described by Bush following his capture as \u201cone of the top operatives plotting and planning death and destruction on the United States.\u201d Subsequent investigations have discovered that these allegations were false, yet Zubaydah remains indefinitely detained at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe report analyzes the so-called torture memos developed by the CIA outlining the specific techniques that were to be utilized against Zubaydah and other detainees in the Global War on Terror. The report also relies on descriptions of the torture techniques provided by Zubaydah, including illustrations drawn by him depicting his torture, as well as internal CIA documents, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report, and other government documents.\r\n\r\nThe so-called torture memos, which were prepared by the CIA in 2002, outline a now-outlawed interrogation program that utilized violence, extreme isolation, and sleep deprivation on detainees in order to extract information and confessions.\r\n\r\nOne of the recently released illustrations drawn by Zubaydah shows the man strapped down naked on a table with a hood covering his head. Water is then poured over his hooded head, simulating a drowning scenario. This \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d technique, often referred to as waterboarding, was later described by the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s study as \u201cbrutal and far worse than the CIA represented.\u201d According to the latest reports, Zubaydah was subjected to this torture technique over 80 times while in CIA custody.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey kept pouring water and concentrating on my nose and my mouth until I really felt I was drowning and my chest was just about to explode from the lack of oxygen,\u201d Zubaydah explained to his lawyer in a declassified report.\r\n\r\nZubaydah was also subjected to a variety of other brutal torture techniques, including prolonged periods of sleep deprivation, having his head slammed repeatedly into a wall, and being confined and isolated in boxes, including in a coffin-shaped box, restricting his movement. Zubaydah recounted that he had been kept awake at one point for \u201cmaybe two or three weeks or even more.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt felt like an eternity,\u201d he stated, \u201cto the point that I found myself falling asleep despite the water being thrown at me by the guard.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe CIA\u2019s interrogation team videotaped many of the torture sessions, only to destroy them all in 2005 at the behest of Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, Zubaydah has not been officially charged or tried for any of his alleged crimes, and remains in federal custody indefinitely.\r\n\r\nZubaydah\u2019s legal team has brought cases before the European Court of Human Rights, whose member countries, including Poland and Lithuania, were at least partially complicit in the extraordinary rendition program that transported detainees such as Zubaydah to CIA black sites for these torture sessions.\r\n\r\nThe latest report demonstrates conclusively once again how far America has strayed from her principles as a result of the prosecution of the Orwellian Global War on Terror.","txt_nwords":659,"txt_nsentences":22,"txt_nparagraphs":14,"topic_k100":"k100_47","topic_k200":"k200_3","topic_k300":"k300_248","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1069,"FB_shares":11.0,"FB_comments":2.0,"FB_reactions":2.0},{"doc_id":"M1e598","URL":"https:\/\/apnews.com\/Business%20Wire\/03b5da0b0cd54eb58da0a59c2f63ef37","website":"apnews.com","seeds":"aids","date":1560729600000,"subcorpus":"mainstream","title":"Walgreens and Greater Than AIDS Partner with Health Departments and Local HIV Organizations Across the Nation to Offer Free Testing on National HIV Testing Day","txt":"Walgreens and Greater Than AIDS Partner with Health Departments and Local HIV Organizations Across the Nation to Offer Free Testing on National HIV Testing Day\r\n\r\nWalgreens and Greater Than AIDS are working with health departments, HIV\/AIDS service organizations, and other community organizations to provide free HIV testing and information at select Walgreens stores in more than 260 cities on National HIV Testing Day (NHTD), Thursday, June 27 between 10 am \u2013 7 pm (local time).

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in seven people living with HIV in the U.S. today are unaware of their status.\r\n\r\n\u201cWalgreens continues to support HIV testing since it is a critical first step in developing effective prevention and care strategies, regardless of status,\u201d said Glen Pietrandoni, senior director, patient care and advocacy, Walgreens. \u201cWith more than 3,000 HIV-trained Walgreens pharmacists in communities across the nation, we can uniquely support HIV testing, education and care, working towards an end to HIV\/AIDS.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to offering on-site free and fast HIV testing, counselors from local agencies will answer questions about HIV prevention and treatment options, including PrEP. No appointment is required.\r\n\r\nThe use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications to prevent HIV transmission, as well as PrEP, a daily pill to protect against HIV, offer new pathways to ending HIV. Based on the strength of the scientific advances, the White House and many states have set ambitious goals of significantly reducing HIV infections over the next decade.\r\n\r\n\u201cPublic knowledge has not always kept up with the science,\u201d said Tina Hoff, Senior Vice President and Director of Health Communications and Media Partnerships at KFF (Kaiser Family Foundation). \u201cPublic-private partnerships like this help to close the knowledge gaps about HIV and connect people with services in their communities to get the care they need.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent national survey by KFF , which runs Greater Than AIDS, fewer than half of Americans know about PrEP, and many understate the health and preventative benefits of HIV treatment.\r\n\r\nThe National HIV Testing Day community partnership is part of an ongoing commitment by Walgreens and Greater Than AIDS to extend the reach of HIV testing and information to non-traditional settings and support the outreach of local agencies. More than 48,000 free HIV tests have been provided since 2011 as part of the annual event.\r\n\r\nBioLytical Laboratories, Chembio Diagnostics, and OraSure Technologies, Inc. are contributing donated test kits and Abbott Rapid Diagnostics is providing support for outreach for the 2019 activation.\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of participating Walgreens locations and supporting partners for this year\u2019s National HIV Testing Day, as well as additional information about HIV testing, including year-round testing sites, visit www.greaterthan.org\/walgreens .\r\n\r\nWalgreens (walgreens.com), one of the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chains, is included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

This involved member currencies effectively floating within narrow ranges against the powerful German Deutsche Mark.\r\n\r\nBut it ended in humiliation for Major and Britain. Hedge funds and the Hungarian billionaire George Soros bet against the pound \u2014 and won.\r\n\r\nSept. 16, 1992 became known as \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d \u2014 a day that saw the British government humbled and seemingly out of control. Though the pound\u2019s exit from the ERM was an economic shock almost unparalleled in the post-war period, it was seen as a gift by the more euroskeptic, or by now euro-hostile, elements within the Conservative Party.\r\n\r\nThe growing tension with Europe was particularly evident during the mad cow's disease outbreak in Britain in 1996, which prompted Brussels to ban imports of British beef. Major sought to bring an end to the EU ban and eventually said Britain would no longer cooperate in EU business until it had been lifted. By June 1996, a framework to lift the ban was agreed but relations had clearly been strained.\r\n\r\nMajor didn't get any of the credit of the ensuing boom that was partly due to the lower pound following its exit from the ERM \u2014 he and his government would be forever tainted by what had occurred on Black Wednesday.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the pro-EU Tony Blair led the Labour Party back into government for the first time in 18 years, with as benign an economic backdrop as any new prime minister could possibly wish for.\r\n\r\nEuroskepticism appeared to be in retreat but behind Blair\u2019s landslide majority lay the first seeds of the 2016 Brexit vote.\r\n\r\nThe Referendum Party, founded and led by the billionaire James Goldsmith to promote another vote on Britain\u2019s EU membership, managed to get 2.6% of the total votes cast, mostly former Conservatives. It may not sound like much, but Goldsmith made a lot of noise.\r\n\r\nWhen the party disbanded after the election and Goldsmith died, the UK Independence Party took on the baton.\r\n\r\nBoy did it \u2014 and UKIP's then chairman Nigel Farage \u2014 run with it.\r\n\r\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https:\/\/www.apnews.com\/Brexit","txt_nwords":556,"txt_nsentences":23,"txt_nparagraphs":17,"topic_k100":"k100_6","topic_k200":"k200_100","topic_k300":"k300_253","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":0.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"doc_id":"M18ea3","URL":"https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/xi-modi-putin-seek-to-strengthen-multilateral-world-order\/a-49428304","website":"dw.com","seeds":"new.world.order","date":null,"subcorpus":"mainstream","title":"Xi, Modi, Putin seek to strengthen multilateral world order | DW | 01.07.2019","txt":"The three leaders' meeting in Osaka last week came days after they got together to discuss mutually relevant issues on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, which took place in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek earlier in June.\r\n\r\nOver the past several years, Russia, China and India have all been adversely affected by growing tensions with the United States, especially after US President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and ended India's preferential trade status that allowed some of the South Asian nation's products to enter the US duty-free. In response, New Delhi imposed retaliatory duties on imports from the US.\r\n\r\nAddressing the trilateral meeting in Osaka, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"As developing economies, it is important that there is a discussion between us on the issues of economy, politics and defense.\" Modi also said that terrorism was a global challenge and must be effectively fought by the international community. India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar, tweeted a summary of Modi's speech during the talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia's foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, later said that the leaders also discussed multilateral challenges. \"All three leaders agreed that in an era of economic and global change, it is important to maintain the trend of globalization, a free rule-based trading system, to oppose tendency towards protectionism.\" The three also spoke about steps to tackle climate change and enhance counterterrorism cooperation.\r\n\r\nRead more: G20 summit 2019: Key questions and answers on Day 1\r\n\r\n\"After the US pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Change Accord \u2014 and given Trump's attitude toward the WTO and the sanctity of multilateral agreements in general \u2014 China, Russia, India and the developing world came together strongly in defense of the multilateral world order,\" political analyst Ravi Bhoothalingam told DW.\r\n\r\nThe meeting in Osaka, Bhoothalingam said, would help reaffirm their resolve to amicably settle their trade and technological issues with the US.\r\n\r\nAndrew Cainey, an Asia expert at the London-based Chatham House, told DW that the meeting \"highlights again the multipolar nature of the world today\u2026the world is not just G2 [the US and China].\"\r\n\r\nHowever, India and Russia would also seek to act in their own interests, crafting their own multilateral strategies with other nations, Cainey said. \"They can, no doubt, reach agreement on some issues: but their situations and interests are fundamentally different.\"\r\n\r\nIndia, for instance, would have to balance its relations with the US and China, while continuing to import defense equipment from Russia. Additionally, \"although they bemoan US 'protectionism,' these countries also have many protectionist attributes,\" Cainey said.\r\n\r\nChallenge for the US\r\n\r\nPolitical analyst Bhoothalingam said that following the trade-war rhetoric with China and India, Trump would \"probably come up with something that defuses the situation \u2014 at least for the time being.\" And as predicted, Trump agreed to resume trade talks with China and said that Washington would not levy tariffs on all remaining imports from China \u2014 more than $300 billion worth.\r\n\r\nThe US president also announced that American technology companies could again begin doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei, reversing a ban that was put in place in May.\r\n\r\nTrump also promised Indian PM Modi \"very big\" trade deals. The talks marked a significant shift from the US president's statements condemning India's retaliatory taxes on imports from the US. Trump also congratulated Modi on his election victory, saying, \"It is a fantastic tribute to you and your abilities.\"\r\n\r\nTrump's interaction with Russian President Putin was similarly friendly, with Trump playfully saying, \"Don't meddle in the election, president,\" as they spoke to reporters.\r\n\r\nChatham House expert Cainey says the US needs to understand the significance of its actions. \"The challenge for the US \u2014 or, at least for some US leaders and policymakers \u2014 is understanding that US actions create their own reactions and second-order changes.\"\r\n\r\nThe trilateral meeting, Cainey underlined, was indicative of a shifting post-war order, \"in part as a result of the rise of China and India, in part as a result of President Trump's actions.\"","txt_nwords":711,"txt_nsentences":28,"txt_nparagraphs":17,"topic_k100":"k100_84","topic_k200":"k200_78","topic_k300":"k300_31","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":17.0,"FB_comments":4.0,"FB_reactions":16.0},{"doc_id":"C04cba","URL":"https:\/\/newstarget.com\/2019-03-15-global-warming-a-total-hoax-and-scam-run-by-corrupt-scientists-warns-greenpeace-co-founder.html","website":"newstarget.com","seeds":"global.warming","date":1552608000000,"subcorpus":"conspiracy","title":"Global warming a total \u201choax and scam\u201d run by corrupt scientists, warns Greenpeace co-founder","txt":"Though the organization today is among the most outspoken when it comes to drumming up mass hysteria over \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d \u2013 its homepage currently has a pop-up urging visitors to sign a petition to \u201cTell Congress to Push for a Green New Deal\u201d \u2013 Greenpeace wasn\u2019t always a shameless advocate for junk science.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the co-founder of Greenpeace Canada, Patrick Moore, recently spilled the beans during an interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, explaining that not only is global warming completely fake, but that it\u2019s also being used by social engineers around the world \u2013 including Greenpeace \u2013 to fear-monger the public in to giving up their rights and freedoms.\r\n\r\nSpeaking with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Moore held nothing back in revealing fear and guilt are being used as conversion tactics to draw more followers into the Cult of Climate Change \u2013 the endgame being to siphon as much cash from people as possible in order to implement a globalist system of governance in which nobody will be allowed to drive big cars, eat meat, use plastic, or in any other way \u201charm\u201d the planet.\r\n\r\n\u201cFear has been used all through history to gain control of people\u2019s minds and wallets and all else, and the climate catastrophe is strictly a fear campaign \u2013 well, fear and guilt \u2013 you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re killing your children because you\u2019re driving them in your SUV and emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and you feel guilty for doing that,\u201d Moore explained during his interview.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no stronger motivation than those two.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more news about the hoax that is global warming and climate change, be sure to visit GlobalWarming.Fetch.news and ClimateScienceNews.com.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreen\u201d companies are also a propaganda-driven fraud, Moore says\r\n\r\nBut what about all of the climate \u201cscientists\u201d who\u2019ve reached a \u201cconsensus\u201d that the earth is heating up because of cow farts, you might be asking?

She died in London, after having suffered a stroke, at 87 years old. Last December, she had undergone an operation to remove a growth from her bladder.\r\n\r\nKnown as the Iron Lady for her toughness, Thatcher had served as the United Kingdom\u2019s only female prime minister, leading her country from 1979 to 1990 as head of the Conservative Party.\r\n\r\nThatcher served longer than any other British prime minister in the 20th Century. She is remembered for her generally conservative views, including weakening trade unions, deregulating industries, divesting state-controlled parts of the economy, and taking a tough stance against Communism.\r\n\r\nThe latter efforts meant she was also often closely allied with Ronald Reagan\u2019s U.S. administration.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Thatcher\u2019s death, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \u201cThe Queen was sad to hear the news of the death of Baroness Thatcher. Her Majesty will be sending a private message of sympathy to the family.\u201d\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron, the U.K.\u2019s current prime minister, said: \u201cIt was with great sadness that l learned of Lady Thatcher\u2019s death. We\u2019ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great Briton.\u201d\r\n\r\nMargaret Thatcher led a long and intriguing political life, which got us thinking about some of the surprising things we learned about her along the way. Here is a brief list:\r\n\r\n1. Soviet Journalists Gave Her the Name \u201cIron Lady\u201d\r\n\r\nLong known as the Iron Lady (including in her 2011 biopic), Thatcher was given that memorable title by Soviet journalists, who had made \u201ca grudging testament to her ferocious will and determination,\u201d in the words of NPR.\r\n\r\nBefore she entered the tough world of politics, Thatcher was a research chemist. In her 20s she worked for J. Lyons and Co. as a food scientist, where she developed additives for ice cream. Her team \u201cdiscovered a method of doubling the amount of air\u201d in ice cream, which eventually found its way into soft serve products.

The Prime Minister would like to be treated in exactly the same manner as the other visiting Heads of Delegation. If other delegation leaders, for example, are each being assigned 20 karate gentlemen, the Prime Minister would have no objection to this; but she does not wish to be singled out.\u201d\r\n\r\n4. Thatcher Did Her Own Cooking\r\n\r\nAlthough Thatcher was prime minister for 11 years, she didn\u2019t have a chef in her employ. Every night, she reportedly cooked dinner for her husband, Denis Thatcher, and she frequently cooked for cabinet members as well.\r\n\r\n5. Thatcher Said She Wouldn\u2019t Have Gone Into Politics in a Do-Over\r\n\r\nIn 1995, Thatcher told Conservative MP Lord Spicer, \u201cIf I had my time again, I wouldn\u2019t go into politics because of what it does to your family.\u201d\r\n\r\nThatcher\u2019s husband Denis died in 2003.

As in the case of Friday's fluoride announcement, today's sulfuryl fluoride limits came in the wake of a revised risk assessment the agency conducted after a 2006 National Academy of Sciences report urged it to consider dental fluorosis as a negative health consequence of exposure rather than a cosmetic impediment.\r\n\r\nDental fluorosis, which manifests as spotting on the teeth among children who consume too much fluoride as their mouths develop, can lead to long-term breakdown of the tooth enamel and other painful effects.\r\n\r\nThe gradual EPA removal of sulfuryl fluoride allowances will be subject to public comment before taking effect and include a three-year head start for significantly affected industries such as the cocoa and walnuts sectors.\r\n\r\nEstimating that the pesticide is applied to 100 percent of cocoa crops, EPA warned in its proposed phaseout that \"cocoa imports (which in 2009 were valued at approximately $1.2 billion) would be lost due to either destruction or refusal of shipments by warehouse operators\" unless businesses can develop a viable alternative to sulfuryl fluoride for cocoa fumigation.\r\n\r\nToday's EPA proposal also references multiple objections Dow had raised in previous years to arguments made by the advocacy groups behind the petition, suggesting that pushback from industry on the sulfuryl fluoride limits can be reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nClick here (pdf) to read a pre-publication copy of EPA's proposal to phase out sulfuryl fluoride tolerances.","txt_nwords":600,"txt_nsentences":15,"txt_nparagraphs":13,"topic_k100":"k100_40","topic_k200":"k200_13","topic_k300":"k300_2","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":388.0,"FB_comments":230.0,"FB_reactions":457.0},{"doc_id":"M20351","URL":"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/nation\/ct-trump-planned-parenthood-abortions-20170306-story.html","website":"latimes.com","seeds":"planned.parenthood","date":1488844800000,"subcorpus":"mainstream","title":"Trump to Planned Parenthood: You can have federal funds if you stop abortions","txt":"President Donald Trump has offered to maintain federal funding for Planned Parenthood if the group stops providing abortions.

But social distancing recommendations still remain, so is swimming in public pools or lounging on the deck \u2014 especially if they're packed with strangers \u2014 safe?\r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says \"there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread to people through the water used in pools, hot tubs or water playgrounds. Additionally, proper operation of these aquatic venues and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus.\" That means, the correct use and disinfection of these spaces should kill the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Filtration systems are effective whether it is a chlorine or saltwater pool.\r\n\r\nThat's great news, but swimming in the pool isn't the whole story when it comes to diving into summer fun. Public pools are public spaces, so social distancing practices are still necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat Does a Safe Public Pool Look Like?\r\n\r\nHopefully, the pool or aquatic venue you visit is following CDC guidelines for these types of settings. These recommendations include:\r\n\r\nSignage or regular announcements by staff reminding visitors about safe practices is a good indication the public pool or water venue is making COVID-19 safety a priority. This holds true for apartment complexes, city pools and water theme parks alike.\r\n\r\nFor example, although Six Flags White Water in Marietta, Georgia, remains closed as of the publish date of this article, the park has created and shared its health and safety re-opening plan, which it developed in coordination with epidemiologists. The plan includes requiring guests and team members to wear masks and temperature checks for both groups.\r\n\r\nHow to Stay Safe at Public Pools\r\n\r\nHeading to the pool, just like visiting any other space indoors or outdoors, requires the practice of safe behaviors. For starters, anyone who has shown symptoms of COVID-19, tested positive for COVID-19 or been exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last two weeks, should stay home.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to go to the pool, wash or sanitize your hands while you're there, cover your coughs and sneezes, and social distance as much as possible. Wear your mask. The CDC reminds that a cloth face covering is most important at times when it is difficult to maintain physical distance from people outside your household.

According to Agbios, an online database on genetically modified crops, more than 32 million acres in the United States has been planted with this type of GM corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany is following in the footsteps of several other EU countries\u2014Austria, Hungary, Greece, France and Luxembourg\u2014which have already banned it in spite of threats of sanctions from globalist groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCiting a move in Luxembourg in early April to ban the cultivation of MON 810, German Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner announced that the German government was taking steps to prohibit farmers from planting the corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two governments based their mandates on European studies that suggest a particular toxin, called Bt, added to the corn on a genetic level may be fatal to \u201cnon-target organisms,\u201d such as ladybugs. Ladybugs and other predator bugs eat pests such as moths and beetles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA symptom of modern agriculture, the heavy use of pesticides has resulted in a never-ending cycle, where good and bad insects are indiscriminately killed and the natural cycle is thrown out of balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorse still, German officials cited research showing that pollen from corn spreads much farther than previously thought. Since corn is pollinated by wind-borne pollen, the concern is that neighboring non-GM corn could become contaminated by genetic material from the Frankenfoods, which blow for miles in the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is substantiated by many organic growers, who contend that it is becoming more and more difficult to find truly heirloom, organic seeds that have not been tainted by genetically modified crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion there are just reasons to assume that the genetically modified [corn] MON 810 represents a danger for the environment,\u201d Ms. Aigner, a member of the conservative Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, told reporters. \u201cTherefore, the cultivation of MON 810 is now banned in Germany.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCritics of genetically modified foods have pointed to several studies, which indicate that foods modified in a laboratory at a genetic level can be hazardous to your health. One recent study in Europe has shown that GM corn fed to rats resulted in rampant infertility. Those that did reproduce suffered from low birth weights for offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the billion-dollar biotech corporation has responded by suing Germany over the ban. In the suit, Monsanto insists that its product, which has been approved by the EU, is \u201csafe to use.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are disappointed and frankly, we don\u2019t believe that they have justification to warrant this,\u201d Brad Mitchell, a spokesman for Monsanto, told a U.S. newspaper. \u201cThey have cited unconvincing evidence that it is unsafe. . . . But the scientific committee of the European Union approved it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EU has responded by saying that Germany is within its rights to ban GM corn, but has issued a threat saying it will block the German government if it uncovers evidence that Germany has banned GM corn because it is pursuing \u201cprotectionist trade measures.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, even if Monsanto fails to overturn Germany\u2019s ruling, the U.S. based corporation can appeal to the global trade body, the World Trade Organization, which Germany is a member of.

Propofol was first tested clinically in 1977. When administered by intravenous injection, it quickly induced anesthesia, with fast and smooth recovery afterward. Animal studies, however, revealed the potential for severe allergic reactions. With subsequent reformulation of propofol into an oil-based emulsion, giving it a milky appearance, this challenge was overcome, and propofol gained widespread use as a key anesthetic agent.\r\n\r\nAs a general anesthetic, propofol initially is given at a relatively high dose to produce a loss of consciousness in the patient and then is infused continuously in smaller amounts to maintain an unresponsive state; this approach typically is used in patients who are undergoing major surgery. At lower doses, propofol acts as a conscious sedative (or procedural sedative), inducing a semiconscious state. The sedative effects set in and wear off quickly, making propofol an effective agent for inducing mild sedation in outpatient surgeries.\r\n\r\nSide effects of propofol include pain at the injection site, hypotension, hypertension, nausea, cough, tingling sensation, and itching Rare side effects include arrhythmia, convulsion, and cardiac arrest. Propofol interacts with numerous other drugs, including chloral hydrate, diazepam, fentanyl, and morphine; such interactions can increase the anesthetic and sedative effects of propofol, producing potentially dangerous effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression and slowing of heart rate.

The WHO called it a \"game-changer\", but until now there had not been any further confirmed cases in the city.\r\n\u2022 Six steps to stop Ebola from spreading\r\n\r\nGoma is a transport hub so the latest death is of particular concern, as it is far harder to isolate patients and trace contacts in major cities, where highly mobile, large populations are living in close proximity.\r\n\r\nThere are fears the illness could spread into Rwanda as people travel between Goma and Gisenyi every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Rwanda has not yet had any confirmed cases, it has set up an Ebola treatment centre and is preparing 23 isolation centres in case of any infections.\r\n\r\n\"Rwanda has made a significant investment in Ebola preparedness,\" WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week.\r\n\r\n\"But as long as the outbreak continues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there is a very real risk of spread to neighbouring countries.\"\r\n\r\nHow bad is the situation in DR Congo?\r\n\r\nMore than 2,500 people have been infected and two-thirds of them have died.\r\n\r\nIt took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000.\r\n\r\nAbout 12 new cases are being reported every day.\r\n\r\nIt is 99% effective and more than 161,000 people have been given it.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everybody is vaccinated - only those who come into direct contact with an Ebola patient, and people who come into contact with them.\r\n\r\nAnd some of those people refuse to take it.\r\n\r\nPeople give a variety of reasons for not taking it: they don't want to put any external liquid in their body; they have a religion that doesn't want them to take vaccines; they don't believe in Ebola or because they think they don't need it.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine, made by Merck, was developed during the epidemic in West Africa and has been available throughout the latest outbreak.\r\n\r\nIt has proven effective but is in relatively short supply so WHO recommended a second vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson to complement it.\r\n\r\nBut the DR Congo's Health Minister Oly Ilunga complained that the Congolese were being treated as \"subjects of experimentation\", reports Reuters, and he resigned over the issue.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn't the outbreak been brought under control?\r\n\r\nTackling the disease has been complicated by conflict in the region.\r\n\r\nSince January, there have been 198 attacks against healthcare workers or Ebola treatment facilities leading to seven deaths and 58 injuries.\r\n\r\nAnother major problem has been distrust of healthcare workers leading to about a third of deaths being in the community rather than at a specialist Ebola treatment centre.\r\n\r\nIt means those people are not seeking treatment and risk spreading the disease to neighbours and relatives.\r\n\r\nThere has also been difficulty tracking the spread of the virus.\r\n\u2022 New Ebola outbreak in DR Congo is 'truly frightening'\r\n\u2022 Large Ebola outbreaks new normal, says WHO\r\n\u2022 Ebola: How a disease is prevented from spreading\r\n\r\nIs the world doing enough to help?\r\n\r\nThe WHO has been clear for months that it has insufficient money to tackle the problem.\r\n\r\nIt had estimated that it needed $98m to tackle the outbreak between February and July. Yet it faced a shortfall of $54m.\r\n\u2022 Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat\r\n\u2022 It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding\r\n\u2022 People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola\r\n\u2022 Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure","txt_nwords":884,"txt_nsentences":48,"txt_nparagraphs":45,"topic_k100":"k100_37","topic_k200":"k200_159","topic_k300":"k300_62","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":null,"cosine_similarity":null,"FB_shares":299.0,"FB_comments":74.0,"FB_reactions":413.0},{"doc_id":"C04c81","URL":"https:\/\/newstarget.com\/2018-09-10-facebook-and-microsoft-release-brain-computer-interface-device-for-thinking-your-way-through-the-internet.html","website":"newstarget.com","seeds":"mind.control","date":1551657600000,"subcorpus":"conspiracy","title":"The race to own your mind: Facebook and Microsoft rush to release brain-computer interface device for THINKING your way through the internet","txt":"The race to own your mind: Facebook and Microsoft rush to release brain-computer interface device for THINKING your way through the internet\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before mind-control technology is unleashed to the masses. The promise of new gadgets that allegedly allow you to surf the web hands-free, with nothing more than the power of your own mind may seem intriguing to some, but there are many concerns about the true price that comes with such an \u201cinteractive\u201d interface. Two of the world\u2019s most hated companies \u2014 Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 are leading the way towards a brain-computer interface that could change the way we use computers, but at what cost?\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, it was revealed that Microsoft filed a patent for a new technology described as a \u201cbrain control interface that decodes electrical signals from the brain to launch and operate apps and web browsers.\u201d The gadget in question would resemble a headband and would even detect when users wish to scroll or click.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\u2019s device would reportedly learn each user\u2019s individual brain behavior via an intricate algorithm \u2014 and could be used in everything from video games to modeling software or simple web browsers.\r\n\r\nIn other words, they want this mind-control software to be everywhere, and in everything.\r\n\r\nLast year, Facebook also confirmed that they were working on similar \u201cmind-control\u201d technology. It appears the tech companies are now racing to tap into the minds of their consumers at an even deeper level. Facebook reportedly has 60 engineers working on the project. \u201cWe\u2019re building further out beyond augmented reality, and that includes work around direct brain interfaces that one day will let you communicate using only your mind, although that stuff is pretty far out,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg commented.\r\n\r\nPlot lines such as this have been featured in many a Sci-Fi novel \u2014 and it rarely ends well in fiction, let alone real life.\r\n\r\nFacebook has already come under fire for using their current social media platform to manipulate their users. The social media giant has often used their tech to block users from seeing content that didn\u2019t align with their agenda \u2014 like articles published by Natural News.\r\n\r\nBut the madness doesn\u2019t stop at censorship. As The Guardian reported in 2014, Facebook conducted an experiment on 689,000 unsuspecting users by controlling what was present in their news feeds. Through a process dubbed \u201cemotional contagion,\u201d Facebook found they could influence their users\u2019 feelings making them feel more positive or negative at whim.\r\n\r\nFacebook has literally used their current technology to control people\u2019s emotions \u2014 what will happen when this corporation has their claws literally inside your mind?\r\n\r\nThis kind of technology sets the stage for the next wave of mind control \u2014 with massive corporations steering the wheel. It would be virtually impossible for the unquestioning user to know if what they \u201csee\u201d in the mind-computer interface is simply what the corporations want them to see or think.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it will be all too easy for tech giants like Facebook or Microsoft to control the news you hear and the advertisements you see, once they\u2019ve got a device that connects directly and effortlessly to your brain.\r\n\r\nSuch technological advancements are undoubtedly impressive; the thought of being able to operate a computer or talk to your friends without ever lifting a finger is fascinating, but ultimately, corporations looking to profit off your thoughts are not exactly trustworthy. Adopting mind-computer interfaces leaves one very question for consumers: Who is in control, you or the corporations? They are building these devices to serve themselves \u2014 and no one else.\r\n\r\nRead more stories about the latest controversies in tech at Glitch.news.","txt_nwords":624,"txt_nsentences":26,"txt_nparagraphs":14,"topic_k100":"k100_16","topic_k200":"k200_83","topic_k300":"k300_275","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1327,"FB_shares":0.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":0.0},{"doc_id":"C009a6","URL":"http:\/\/revolutionradio.org\/2019\/03\/06\/alien-miguel-merecias-lopez-charged-with-making-10000-fake-ids-in-oregon-lab-sold-across-the-us\/","website":"revolutionradio.org","seeds":"alien","date":1551830400000,"subcorpus":"conspiracy","title":"Alien Miguel Merecias-Lopez Charged with Making 10,000 Fake IDs in Oregon Lab \u2013 Sold Across the US","txt":"Miguel Merecias-Lopez pleaded guilty of conspiracy to produce more than 10,000 fake IDs that were sold across America.\r\n\r\nThe fake document operation was operating in Woodburn, Oregon for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe Fraud Doc Ring communicated with customers using Facebook, email, Snapchat and in person, the plea deal states.

(RELATED: Read more about fake science predictions at fakesciencenews.com.)\r\n\r\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. As alluded to above, according to a lengthy essay published on the Association for Physiological Science website, \u201cA growing body of evidence shows that rapid global warming can (and is) increasing violent behavior.\u201d\r\n\r\nReferencing numerous studies, they argue that people tend to get hot under the collar, and physically aggressive when the temperature rises to an uncomfortable level. They also maintain that violent crime spikes in areas with higher temperatures. Other factors include malnourishment \u2014 which is driven, in their view, by climate-related food insecurity \u2014 in kids leads to antisocial behavior when they become adults. Scarce resources are also supposedly a factor in the rise of terrorism.\r\n\r\nThe academics also sound the alarm about ecomigration that could lead to conflicts with the local population, \u201cwhere entire groups migrate in response to the physical, economic, or political instability brought about by an ecological disaster.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cClearly, there is a need, and indeed there are many ways, for psychologists to weigh in on the issue of climate change and its relation to violent behavior,\u201d the authors conclude.\r\n\r\nRead the entire exposition and draw your own conclusions.\r\n\r\nAs Natural News previously wondered, however about the so-called global warming consensus,\u201dThe issue isn\u2019t whether climate change is real or not, but whether we can continue to allow agenda-driven scientific dogma to direct academic research and public policy.\u201d (RELATED: Read more about the climate change movement at ClimateScienceNews.com)\r\n\r\nFor discussion purposes, could global warming have caused the mob violence last week at the University of California at Berkeley when conservative journalist Milo Yiannopoulos tried to deliver a scheduled speech?\r\n\r\nOr was it more likely the result of pre-orchestrated actions by anti-Milo, anti-President Trump anarchists allegedly paid by George Soros-funded groups to take to the streets?

They are quite intentionally devoid of detail. In that regard, of course, they are not supposed to be read as analytical remarks, but as diplomatic signals.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the most loud and clear signal contained above is a dig at President Trump.\r\n\r\nThis quickly follows Angela Merkel\u2019s highly fruitful meeting with President Putin on January 11th, after which both leaders confirmed that the Nord Stream 2 project would press ahead in spite of US sanctions. Chancellor Merkel also said that she hoped Russian-Turkish attempts to broker peace-talks would be successful, and announced that Libyan ceasefire talks would soon take place in Berlin. She also said that it was an \u201cimportant step\u201d that the Iranian government had admitted that the January 8th crash of Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 had been the result of an \u201cunintentional human error\u201d on the part of Iranian military personnel.\r\n\r\n2 more clear signals, delivered like knives to Dim Donnie\u2019s heart.\r\n\r\nWith the fallout from the Soleimani-assassination not yet settled, the temptation for European political and diplomatic figures to signal disdain for Trump by love-bombing Putin seems irresistible at the moment. It\u2019s like watching a few 16 year-old kids setting jealousy-traps for each other in your garden-variety teenage love-triangle. It\u2019s quite amusing.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that Brandon\u2019s new smartphone is cooler than Jimmy\u2019s,\u201d says Ashley\u2026.\r\n\r\nOf course, we know it\u2019ll all be different next week, but middle-aged dads still find the silliness of it all comedic.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the seriousness of Trump\u2019s miscalculation concerning the Soleimani assassination, and the manner that his stance toward Iran has unfolded since then. Even Benjamin Netanyahu took pains to publicly distance himself from that decision, stating that Israeli politicians should stay out of the discussion. Given that the United Kingdom is the United States\u2019 most uncritically subservient ally, Boris Johnson\u2019s public criticism of Trump\u2019s threat to bomb Iranian historical and cultural sites was also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nWas this another signal?\r\n\r\nNot exclusively. While Johnson would not be in the least bit concerned about the prospect of a military skirmish around Hormuz resulting in fatalities, apart from its economic consequences, he is still proud of being a trained classicist \u2013 the prospect of bombing an ancient archaeological site probably offends his basic sense of human decency even more than the prospect of war itself.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, everyone is perfectly well aware that war with Iran could very well trigger a global economic depression, and that is the factor which principally determines the reactions of US-allies\u2019 to Trump\u2019s hair-brained belligerence toward Iran.\r\n\r\nAnd, regardless of the highly publicized personal antagonisms which have characterized Merkel\u2019s relationships with Putin in the past, Nord Stream 2 is still a no-brainer, with or without US sanctions. Liquefied natural gas exported from the US to the EU is 30% more expensive than Russian gas. It\u2019s just not competitive. It\u2019s that simple. The fact that the German government has decided to abandon nuclear energy, which currently accounts for 34% of German domestic electricity-production, makes this point even more crucial. In the long term, personal antagonisms are trivial \u2013 the bottom line will ultimately determine long-term policy.\r\n\r\nIn my younger days, I used to play chess in tournaments. Most ordinary, club-level, tournament chess-players will insist on the wisdom of the maxim that you should play the board, not the opponent. It doesn\u2019t matter who your opponent is, or what kind of personality they have. Chess is mathematics, not psychology. Play the board-position on its strategic merits, and forget about absolutely everything else. Play the board!\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian crisis was deliberately engineered, among very many other factors, in order to disrupt gas-transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 circumvents that point of rupture, so the US tries to shut it down with sanctions. That doesn\u2019t work either. The 30% price-differential is simply too wide for sanctions to disincentivize it.\r\n\r\nUnder the Obama administration, the US effectively lost geo-strategic control over Turkey and the Philippines. Those losses of territory were made possible only by massive blunders. Under the Trump administration, the US is in the process of gradually losing geo-strategic control over Germany, having already decisively alienated France, which will make it increasingly difficult to maintain any meaningful geo-strategic foothold in western Eurasia.\r\n\r\nBut then again, until 2016, liberal universalism was the ideological glue which held the western alliance together. Trump\u2019s election meant that it was always on borrowed time.\r\n\r\nWith these factors considered, we might ask how much difference the assassination of General Soleimani really made to US-EU relations. Yes, it was jaw-droppingly reckless and strategically pointless. Yes, it severely alienated many US-allies. However, from the perspective of the United States\u2019 continental European allies, we have to ask, was it merely an incidental moment of realization? We have to expect that the macro-economic fundamentals would have forced an epiphany sooner or later. The Soleimani assassination, as fundamentally reckless as it was, essentially did nothing to change the positions of any on the pieces on the geo-strategic chessboard. It merely acted as an incidental cognitive trigger, whereupon some of the players woke up to the board-position a little sooner.\r\n\r\nPadraig McGrath is a political analyst.

Check out the latest drought map of the state. Almost 100% of the state is in severe drought conditions. Many parts of the West are also experiencing drought, but California is ground-zero. This is a huge food growing region, and the state has just started restricting water to agriculture. This is a vast problem not only for the U.S., but the entire world, and there is no end in sight. California is a state with a population of nearly 40 million people. Some towns have been cut off, and some people are starting to store drinking water in their homes. This could spark a humanitarian crisis and a financial crisis. You cannot live or do business without ample supplies of water. California has a GDP of $2.2 trillion. Agriculture alone is $46 billion a year. Failure of California business would be a financial failure for the U.S. It is only projected to get worse. Is this a black swan hiding in plain sight? Might I remind you that in March, NASA said California had about one year\u2019s worth of water before it runs out. So, we are t-minus 9 months and counting.\r\n\r\nThe Greek debt crisis got kicked into a higher gear and is speeding for default and disaster. Technically, I think the Greeks have already defaulted long ago because they are borrowing more and more money to pay their debts. This week, the Greek politicians said debt owed to the EU was \u201cillegal and illegitimate.\u201d They cannot and will not pay the money back. The only question remains is when does the default become official. It\u2019s reported the Greek\u2019s have run on the banks there, and they do not know if they will open on Monday. Will someone like the Federal Reserve step in and buy some time. Greece is a NATO country, and it just signed a gas pipeline deal with Russia. It\u2019s getting complicated. Will someone like the Federal Reserve step in and buy some time? Does the EU cough up the remaining 7.2 billion euro loan package to kick the can towards the cliff? Who knows, but end it will sooner than later.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve will not be raising rates, and it has reduced the growth estimates it had. Gregory Mannarino says, \u201cThe Fed cannot and will not be raising rates because it can\u2019t.\u201d He points to recent so-called core inflation rates just announced of .1%. Of course, it\u2019s much higher than that, but Mannarino says the Fed is only worried about the \u201ccore rate.\u201d There is no growth and if the Fed raised rates, it would implode the economy. And yet, the mainstream press says \u201cFed on track to raise rates this fall.\u201d IMF Head Christine Lagarde just publicly scolded the Fed and told them \u201cnot to raise rates\u201d because the economy was too weak. Then you have this out earlier in the week from the same USA Today that says \u201cBonds haven status gets shaky.\u201d Meanwhile, the AP reports in the same week \u201cEconomists don\u2019t fear rise in rates.\u201d Really?? Maybe someone should tell that to Christine Lagarde and the entire bond market the raising interest rates are not going to be a problem\u2014NOT.\r\n\r\nLooks like the GOP got a win in the secret trade deal. The House narrowly passed part of the trade deal. It is the so-called Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA. Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said, \u201cThe TPA is a process and not an agreement.\u201d Of course, he did not say and none of the other mainstream media (MSM) don\u2019t think a secret trade deal is a problem.

NPR\u2019s Morning Edition (1\/3\/19), on the other hand, has just run an upbeat segment on how violating other people\u2019s borders is now a tad more challenging for American spies than it was in past decades: \u201cCIA Chief Pushes For More Spies Abroad; Surveillance Makes That Harder,\u201d reported by Greg Myre.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cpush,\u201d in fact, came in September, when CIA Director Gina Haspel\u2014herself a former longtime undercover officer abroad\u2014announced her desire for a \u201clarger foreign footprint\u201d for the CIA. Four months later, it\u2019s the hook for NPR\u2019s human interest story on frustrating impediments to spying.\r\n\r\nMyre brings in various characters to populate his narrative, all of them current or ex-CIA employees. First is Jonna Mendez, former CIA \u201cchief of disguise,\u201d whom Myre tells us will give us \u201ca few key tips\u201d for Americans trying to appear European:\r\n\r\n[Europeans] wear their wedding rings on different fingers. They eat differently than we do. They don\u2019t shuttle that fork back and forth\u2026. They stand up straight.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s retired CIA officer John Sipher, who \u201csays it could be tough today to enter the same country twice with different sets of documents.\u201d Things were much easier back in the 1980s, we\u2019re told, when airports didn\u2019t scan faces and fingerprints, and everyone wasn\u2019t online.\r\n\r\nNext up with some remarks on social media are Sheronda, the CIA\u2019s chief of recruiting, and Mary, an undercover officer. Incidentally, Sheronda\u2019s soundbite\u2014\u201cPeople here do use social media. And yes, specific guidelines are provided\u201d\u2014is the same one that appeared in Myre\u2019s March 2018 NPR report \u201cCIA Recruiting: The Rare Topic the Spy Agency Likes to Talk About\u201d (3\/26\/18), which might as well have been titled \u201cHey Kids! Here\u2019s How to Join the CIA.\u201d\r\n\r\nMyre\u2019s latest pro bono public relations effort on behalf of the agency meanwhile ends on some thoughts about how all the technology in the world can\u2019t replace \u201cthe human touch\u201d when it comes to intelligence gathering. \u201cIt\u2019s a job of human beings,\u201d says Mendez.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the following question: Why is NPR trying so hard to humanize an organization that is downright anti-human? After all, it\u2019s not like the CIA\u2019s machinations abroad are restricted to wedding ring protocol, fork-shuttling and improved posture\u2014and a few details from its sordid history might have helped to contextualize Haspel\u2019s current CIA proliferation scheme.\r\n\r\nAmong the major milestones on the agency\u2019s timeline are, of course, the 1953 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Iran\u2019s Mohammad Mossadegh and reinstatement of the brutal shah\u2014an obsessive purchaser of US weapons\u2014and the 1954 coup against Guatemala\u2019s Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, which helped set the stage for a long and gruesome war that killed or disappeared over 200,000 Guatemalans. (The CIA\u2019s training of Guatemalan death squads is still bearing consequences in the form of waves of refugees fleeing that country\u2019s ongoing violence\u2014The Nation, 1\/3\/19.)\r\n\r\nAlso in Central America, the CIA was instrumental in the bloody Contra campaign of the 1980s\u2014what Noam Chomsky has referred to as \u201ca large-scale terrorist war against Nicaragua.\u201d The war effort was also aided by top Honduran drug lord Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros, owner of the Contra supply airline SETCO\u2014which, scholar Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz recalls in her Contra war memoir, Blood on the Border, was known as the \u201cCIA airline.\u201d Around the same time, a CIA-trained elite death squad by the name of Battalion 316 \u201cstalked, kidnapped, tortured and murdered hundreds of Honduran men and women\u201d\u2014as the Baltimore Sun (6\/13\/95) put it\u2014effectively \u201cterroriz[ing] Honduras for much of the 1980s.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, the CIA reportedly devised no fewer than 638 ways to kill Fidel Castro\u2014one of them, recalled by the Guardian (8\/2\/06), was inspired by Castro\u2019s fondness for scuba diving and involved \u201cinvest[ment] in a large volume of Caribbean mollusks\u201d: \u201cThe idea was to find a shell big enough to contain a lethal quantity of explosives, which would then be painted in colors lurid and bright enough to attract Castro\u2019s attention when he was underwater.\u201d An impressive allocation of time and resources, indeed.\r\n\r\nCloser to home, the CIA conducted LSD experiments on unwitting US citizens in the 1950s\u2014and, speaking of drugs, the agency has often been up to its ears in them (despite that whole drug war the US perennially professes to be waging). A 1993 article in the International Herald Tribune (12\/3\/93) observed that, while \u201cCIA ties to international drug trafficking date to the Korean War,\u201d nowhere was the organization \u201cmore closely tied to drug traffic than it was in Pakistan during the Afghan War.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the devastating US war on Vietnam and neighboring countries, the Herald Tribune article specified, heroin refined in Laos was \u201cferried out on the planes of the CIA\u2019s front airline, Air America.\u201d A 2009 post by historian John Prados at the National Security Archive (8\/26\/09) confirmed that the \u201cagency\u2019s broad span of activities reached into virtually every aspect of the Indochina war,\u201d as the CIA \u201cactually conducted a full-scale war in Laos and ran a variety of paramilitary programs in South Vietnam.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe list goes on. But the point, in short, is that many global inhabitants would presumably not grieve too terribly if modern-day surveillance were to complicate the CIA\u2019s drive for a \u201clarger foreign footprint.\u201d\r\n\r\nNor should we forget the CIA\u2019s contemporary history of extraordinary rendition and torture\u2014a track record that leads us to Haspel herself. As Lisa Hajjar, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the author of Torture: A Sociology of Violence and Human Rights, wrote for The Nation (3\/16\/18): Haspel \u201cplayed a leading role in the agency\u2019s program of torture, kidnapping and forced disappearance during the [George W.] Bush administration.\u201d Most specifically, Haspel \u201coversaw the interrogation and torture of a Saudi national named Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri\u201d at a black site in Thailand in 2002.\r\n\r\nBut back to NPR\u2014which, as it so happens, is not the hugest fan of the T-word. In 2009, then\u2013NPR vice president for news Ellen Weiss denied reports that the outlet had banned the use of the word \u201ctorture\u201d altogether:\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s doubtless thanks to these guidelines that we end up with, for example, an NPR dispatch (2\/25\/15) on the US Senate\u2019s 2014 CIA torture report in which \u201ctorture\u201d appears a total of two times. The first is in the introductory sentence: \u201cFor years in the military courtroom at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, there\u2019s been a subject no one could talk about: torture.\u201d Lest anyone think that we\u2019re now going to talk about it, the only other reference is to \u201cwhat many call \u2018the torture report.\u2019\u201d NPR did, however, manage to describe in less \u201cloaded language\u201d one Guant\u00e1namo defendant\u2019s chronic bleeding on account of overzealous rectal examination by the CIA\u2014but, again, it\u2019s important not to take sides.\r\n\r\nIn Myre\u2019s segment, Jonna Mendez says that one of her responsibilities as the former CIA chief of disguise was to \u201cde-Americanize\u201d spies. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, it seems torture and other misdeeds are as American as apple pie; ditto, apparently, for media whitewashing of nefarious intelligence agencies.\r\n\r\n*This article was originally published on fair.","txt_nwords":1381,"txt_nsentences":47,"txt_nparagraphs":21,"topic_k100":"k100_63","topic_k200":"k200_126","topic_k300":"k300_241","mention_conspiracy":0,"conspiracy_representative":0.0,"cosine_similarity":0.1395,"FB_shares":1.0,"FB_comments":0.0,"FB_reactions":1.0},{"doc_id":"C04685","URL":"https:\/\/www.infowars.com\/chinese-telecoms-build-5g-base-stations-on-mt-everest\/","website":"infowars.com","seeds":"5g","date":1588636800000,"subcorpus":"conspiracy","title":"Chinese Telecoms Build 5G Base Stations On Mt.

The technologies enhance speeds via its massive multi input, multi output (MIMO) technology, increasing speed and capacity by monitoring users per base station and using beamforming, which transmits data directly to each device.\r\n\r\nAccording to a press release, such advancements allow cheaper, faster installations for building networks across numerous regions, including urban and harsh environments.\r\n\r\nThe news comes 60 years after mountaineers first climbed the world\u2019s tallest mountain at its north ridge and 45 years after the first official and accurate measurement of the summit.\r\n\r\nThe announcement comes nearly a decade after Huawei installed the world\u2019s highest GSM network at 5200m above sea level.\r\n\r\nThe company said in a statement:\r\n\r\n\u201cHuawei strongly believes that technology means to make the world better.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2011 urged banks to better manage the risks of their merchant customers who employ payment processors, such as PayPal, for credit card transactions. The FDIC listed gun retailers as \u201chigh risk\u201d along with porn stores and drug paraphernalia shops.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department has launched Operation Choke Point, a credit card fraud probe focusing on banks and payment processors. The threat of enforcement has prompted some banks to cut ties with online gun retailers, even if those companies have valid licenses and good credit histories.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis administration has very clearly told the banking industry which customers they feel represent \u2018reputational risk\u2019 to do business with,\u201d said Peter Weinstock, a lawyer at Hunton & Williams LLP. \u201cSo financial institutions are reacting to this extraordinary enforcement arsenal by being ultra-conservative in who they do business with: Any companies that engage in any margin of risk as defined by this administration are being dropped.\u201d\r\n\r\nA Justice Department representative said the agency is conducting several investigations that aim to hold accountable banks \u201cwho are knowingly assisting fraudulent merchants who harm consumers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring that our efforts to combat fraud do not discourage or inhibit the lawful conduct of these honest merchants,\u201d the Justice Department said in a May 7 blog post.\r\n\r\nBut gun retailers say their businesses are being targeted in the executive branch\u2019s efforts:\r\n\u2022 T.R.

Gun parts maker American Spirit Arms in Scottsdale, Arizona, received similar treatment by Bank of America, the country\u2019s largest banking institution.\r\n\r\nAfter McMillan Group owner Kelly McMillan publicized Bank of America\u2019s action on his Facebook account, he found that thousands of small gun-shop owners across the country were in the same situation. Banks were either dropping them, freezing their accounts or refusing to process their online sales, so he opened a credit card processing company for the gun industry called McMillan Merchant Solutions.\r\n\r\n\u201cFour generations of my family have been in this industry.

That wide body jets flew into the twin towers and completely destroyed them. Let me repeat that: Passenger planes (large hollow aluminum tubes) flew into industrial steel, marble and concrete sky scrapers, and caused them to turn into a pile of dust. And the worst part about this fairy tale is that we, the American people believed it. Now, nine years later, it's time to wake up from your slumber and take a good hard look at what did and did not happen on that fateful day. The conventional explanation we were provided, by government and media, for a top-down highly destructive gravitational collapse, in near-free-fall times, is physically impossible, and is thus about as worthy of discussion as is the belief that the Earth is flat.\r\n\r\nFICTION: Passenger jets flew into the Twin Towers, and the burning jet fuel caused them to collapse.\r\n\r\nFACT: The Twin Towers did not collapse. They suffered a mid-air pulverization due to an extreme unconventional energy source that caused the initial upward trajectory of so much of the towers' mass during the 'collapses' as (supposedly only) gravity was pulling them down.\r\n\r\nThe burning jet fuel melted all of the steel beams causing the buildings to collapse directly onto their own footprint.\r\n\r\nFACT: 80% of each of the towers 50 million ton mass NEVER hit the ground. The steel did not melt, but turned into nano-dust. Pulverization + Molecular Dissociation = Ground Zero Evidence. When matter is elevated to temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, results. Molecular Dissociation (MD) is easy to understand once we realize that there are four (4) states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Just as ice has trouble surviving in water or steam, molecules have trouble surviving in plasma, which is highly energetic (ie, hot). When molecules dissociate, they leave behind loose atoms and fragments of molecules. In other words, small particles. In this sense, it is correct to think of molecular dissociation as disintegration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving occurred at Ground Zero in New York City, we have a very strong indication that only exotic, unconventional weaponry could have released that much extremely -- unimaginably -- high intensity energy which suddenly appeared just as the towers disintegrated from top to bottom. This understanding means we cannot blame the highly unconventional Ground Zero devastation on thermite\/thermate\/super thermate and \"controlled demolition\" any more than we can blame it on \"jet fuel\" or \"box cutters\".\r\n\r\nIn a \"pancake collapse\" the rubble pile should be at least 1\/8 of the original building height (12.5%). The actual rubble pile was no more than 2% of the original building height. Both towers went \"poof.\"\r\n\r\nSo where did these 110 story tall 50 million ton sky scrapers go?\r\n\r\nThey were turned into nano-dust and 80% of the \"dust\" floated off into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: A huge steel beam from the south tower falters, turns to \"dust\" and blows away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat only exotic, unconventional weaponry could have released that much extremely -- unimaginably -- high intensity energy to cause the pulverization and molecular dissociation of these buildings, let's look at some of the other unexplainable anomalies..\r\n\r\nAll of these cars have unexplainable similar damage: Paint gone, instant rusting, and all of their door handles and engine blocks are missing!\r\n\r\nA squad car on FDR drive with wilted doors, burned paint, instant rust and no door handles or engine block.\r\n\r\nStrange fires appear to be attracted to the engine blocks, while the gas tanks and nearby paper are not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuildings a few blocks away,had mysterious holes in the windows, and the front marble fa\u00e7ade is completely gone, but no other damage.\r\n\r\nFor months we witnessed trucks coming and going from Ground Zero and the media told us they were hauling away the steel. What steel? There was very little steel left in the rubble because it had been pulverized into nano-dust. So what were these trucks really hauling back and forth? Dirt! They hauled in dirt, spread it all over Ground Zero, then scooped it up and hauled it away, and this went on for years. Didn't they do that at Chernobyl? Yes they did!\r\n\r\nSo now you know what didn't cause the buildings to \"vanish.\" Planes, jet fuel and thermite are irrelevant. So what kind of unconventional energy could have caused the Twin Towers to turn to dust? A fissionless fusion thermo nuclear event? Direct Energy Weapons? HAARP? A scaled up weaponized version of The Hutchison Effect?
